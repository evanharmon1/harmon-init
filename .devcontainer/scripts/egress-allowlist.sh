# egress-allowlist.sh — default-deny egress for the AGENT devcontainer
# (docs/decisions/2026-09-29-agent-posture-three-posture-model.md, #286).
#
#   egress-allowlist.sh apply    — resolve the allowlist and install it as the
#                                  container's OUTPUT/FORWARD filter: allowed
#                                  destinations pass, everything else is
#                                  REJECTed and its address recorded. Runs as
#                                  root (re-execs through `sudo -n`). Exits
#                                  non-zero — failing the lifecycle step that
#                                  called it — if enforcement cannot be
#                                  installed, and then removes the filter's
#                                  allow rules and leaves the OUTPUT and
#                                  FORWARD policies DROP (fail_closed below).
#                                  Idempotent; re-run it to pick up
#                                  rotated CDN addresses. The agent lifecycle
#                                  runs it only from the snapshot below.
#   egress-allowlist.sh snapshot — validate the lists, then copy this applier
#                                  and both lists to a root-owned directory
#                                  (/usr/local/share/harmon-egress). Every
#                                  later apply runs from there, so an edit to
#                                  the writable checkout cannot widen egress
#                                  at the next start. Root.
#   egress-allowlist.sh establish — agent post-create's single egress step:
#                                  install iptables, snapshot, then apply FROM
#                                  the snapshot, with the same fail_closed
#                                  exit as apply around all three. Root.
#
# "Fails closed" means: once running as root, every exit of apply or
# establish short of a verified filter — a refused list, a failed iptables
# install, a failed rule, a failed verify, a signal — flushes the chain's
# allow rules, sets the OUTPUT and FORWARD policies to DROP for every address
# family the container has, and exits non-zero. It says egress was left at
# DROP only when every one of those steps succeeded; otherwise — no iptables
# at all, or any step failing — it prints a CRITICAL do-not-use line instead.
# Either way the create or start that ran it fails, and a container whose
# create or start failed must not be used.
#   egress-allowlist.sh verify   — fail unless the default-deny filter is in
#                                  place (root; re-execs through `sudo -n`).
#   egress-allowlist.sh blocked  — print every destination refused since the
#                                  container started, for the lane report. No
#                                  root needed.
#   egress-allowlist.sh plan     — print the resolved allow set without
#                                  touching the filter (used by the unit test).
#   egress-allowlist.sh hosts    — print the validated list entries.
#
# The lists: .devcontainer/egress-allowlist.txt (shared, owned by harmon-init)
# plus the optional per-repo .devcontainer/egress-allowlist.local.txt, read
# relative to this script — so the snapshot copy reads the snapshot's lists.
# Format is documented at the top of the shared list. A literal address may
# not be 0.0.0.0 in any form, nor a CIDR wider than /16: either would turn one
# list line into an allow-everything rule. The same refusal applies to every
# range fetched through @github-meta, which becomes a rule unreviewed: an
# over-broad one fails the plan (and so apply) rather than being skipped. IPv6
# literals are not accepted at all — v6 egress is closed outright (see apply).
#
# Scope, stated plainly: this is enforcement INSIDE the container's network
# namespace, which needs CAP_NET_ADMIN. It bounds what the agent harnesses
# reach — their permission layers deny the commands that would rewrite the
# filter (sudo, iptables, nft) — but it is not a boundary against root inside
# the container. DNS is allowed to the configured resolvers only, so DNS
# itself remains a narrow channel. Both residuals are recorded in the ADR.
