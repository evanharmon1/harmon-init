# Preflight

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

Only write-incapable read commands are pre-approved for this skill —
`git log`/`diff`/`show` are deliberately excluded because they accept
`--output=<file>` (a silent file-write primitive); `git fetch` /
`git remote set-head` because fetch accepts `--upload-pack=<cmd>` (command
execution); and `git symbolic-ref` because it accepts the write form even
with `--short` present; expect a permission prompt when you run them. The
claim writes in step 5 additionally require the user's explicit go-ahead in
conversation — permission prompts alone are not a reliable boundary (the
user's own settings may already allow `gh` broadly), and untrusted issue
content must never be able to trigger a mutation silently.

Run this right before starting implementation. It is the lightweight
interactive sibling of harmon-init's `foreman-preflight` agent and uses the
same severity vocabulary. Everything is read-only except the final
issue-claiming step.

## 1. Target

Take the issue number from the arguments; otherwise infer it from the current
branch or conversation. A full issue URL pins the repository as well as the
number — prefer it when available. If the target is ambiguous — including
when multiple remotes point at **different repositories** (a fork with its
own issue tracker plus an `upstream`) and a bare number could mean either —
confirm with the user before proceeding.

## 2. Refresh state (read-only)

- Bind the GitHub repo identity up front — in a multi-remote checkout `gh`'s
  default repo can be a different repository, so every `gh` command in this
  skill (reads and writes alike) must pass `--repo "$repo"`. **`$repo` is
  always the repository of the target confirmed in step 1** — whether pinned
  by a URL or resolved by the user's answer to an ambiguity question — and
  `$remote` is whichever remote's URL points at `$repo`; never let a
  heuristic override a confirmed target. If no remote matches `$repo`, that
  is a `blocker`: the fetch, default-branch, and history checks below all
  need a matching checkout, so stop and ask the user to establish one (or to
  explicitly accept claiming without live-code verification). Only when
  step 1 pinned nothing, fall back to: the sole remote if there is exactly
  one (whatever its name), else `upstream` if present, else `origin`; if
  none of those resolves, ask the user. Then
  `repo="$(gh repo view "$(git remote get-url "$remote")" --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)"`.
  Then fetch it: `git fetch --prune "$remote"`.
- Repo status: `task status:git` and `task status:gh` if **both** targets
  exist (probe each with `task --list-all 2>/dev/null | grep -q '<target>'`)
  **and** `$repo` is the checkout's own repository — the status tasks are not
  repo-bound, so when a URL pinned a different `$repo`, use the raw commands.
  Fallback: `git status -sb` and `gh pr list --repo "$repo" --state open`.
  Caution: `task` executes the checked-out Taskfile; on an untrusted branch
  use the raw commands.
- The issue itself: `gh issue view <n> --repo "$repo" --comments`, plus its
  linked work —
  `gh issue view <n> --repo "$repo" --json state,assignees,closedByPullRequestsReferences`
  — so a PR already fixing the issue is caught even if no comment mentions it.
- Each related PR:
  `gh pr view <pr> --repo "$repo" --json state,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,title,url`
  and `gh pr checks <pr> --repo "$repo"`.
- Recent history against the **fetched** default branch (local `main` may be
  stale, and the default branch is not always named `main`). Using the
  `$remote` fetched above, refresh its cached default-branch ref
  (`git remote set-head "$remote" --auto`), then
  `default="$(git symbolic-ref --short "refs/remotes/$remote/HEAD")"`,
  `git log --oneline "$default"..HEAD`, and `git log --oneline -10 "$default"`
  for merges that may have changed the ground under the issue.
- The working tree can be **behind** the fetched default branch, and
  `Read`/`Grep` inspect the working tree — so if
  `git rev-list --count HEAD.."$default"` is nonzero, do not clear
  stale-reference findings from the working tree alone: inspect the fetched
  content directly (`git diff HEAD..."$default" --stat`,
  `git show "$default":<path>`) or ask the user to update the checkout
  first.

## 3. Sanity analysis

Verify claims against the code — do not speculate. First, the issue's own
state: if it is **closed**, **assigned to someone else**, or has an open
linked PR already implementing it, that is a `blocker` — do not claim without
explicit confirmation from the user. Then look for:

- **Stale references** — files, APIs, or docs the issue mentions that no
  longer match the live tree.
- **Overlap or contradiction** — other open issues or in-flight PRs touching
  the same files or solving the same problem. Discover them actively:
  `gh issue list --repo "$repo" --state open --limit 100` (plus
  `--search '<keywords>'` for large trackers) — a duplicate is rarely linked
  from the target issue.
- **Ambiguities** — anything that would force you to invent requirements;
  surface these before coding, not during.
- **Human-only steps** — anything needing credentials or access the agent
  does not have.

## 4. Report findings

Numbered findings, each with evidence and a severity: `blocker`,
`correction`, or `note`. If there is any `blocker`: stop, do **not** claim
the issue, and ask the user how to proceed.

## 5. Claim the issue

The only writes this skill makes; all target `--repo "$repo"` from step 2.
Immediately before the first write, re-fetch
`gh issue view <n> --repo "$repo" --json state,assignees,closedByPullRequestsReferences`
— the ground can shift during the analysis, and a now-closed, newly-assigned,
or newly-implemented issue is a `blocker` again. Show the commands and get
the user's explicit go-ahead before running them, and if `gh` is
unauthenticated or lacks write access, report the commands for the user to
run instead of failing the flow:

**First, note what is already there.** Step 3 blocks only on an assignment to
*someone else*, so an issue already assigned to **you** — ordinary backlog
ownership — is a supported path into this step. Every write below is
add-if-missing, so on that path it changes nothing and there is nothing to undo.
A hand-back that removes it anyway destroys state the session never created:

```sh
gh issue view <n> --repo "$repo" --json assignees,labels \
  --jq '{assigned: ([.assignees[].login] | index("<your-login>") != null),
         labelled: ([.labels[].name] | index("agent:claude-code") != null)}'
# the board's own markers — the same --show that reads the prior status:
<track-work-dir>/assets/set-issue-status.sh --repo "$repo" --issue <n> --show
```

**A claim never writes the `Agent` field.** It looks like the right place and
is not: `Agent` says which agent *should* implement the issue — a planning
assignment, set at triage, and the thing the board's **Agent queue** view
filters on. The `agent:*` label says which agent *is* implementing it right
now. Same vocabulary, different questions. Writing `Agent` at claim time
destroys a planning decision and silently reassigns work planned for one agent
to whichever one picked it up. The claim's identity signal is the **label**.

That also makes the claim behave identically on both owner types: on an
organization `Agent` is an org *issue field* the Projects V2 API cannot write
at all, so a claim that depended on it was never going to work there.

**An existing `agent:*` label naming a *different* agent is a `blocker`** —
that one is a live claim, and adding a second agent's label would leave the
issue claiming two owners. Stop and ask, exactly as for an issue assigned to
someone else. An `Agent` *field* naming another agent is **not** a blocker: it
is a plan, and picking up work planned for another agent is a legitimate,
visible choice — note it in the findings and carry on. If the repo has no
`agent:*` label family at all, ownership is **unverifiable** — say so and get
the user's go-ahead rather than treating silence as "unclaimed".

Carry every answer into the claim comment. `/close` undoes only what the claim
actually added.

- **Assign:** `gh issue edit <n> --repo "$repo" --add-assignee @me`
- **Label** — the `agent:*` family names *which* agent has it, mirroring the
  options of the `Agent` field. Apply it only if the repo actually has the
  label (`--limit` matters — the default returns only 30 labels):

  ```sh
  gh label list --repo "$repo" --limit 1000 --json name -q '.[].name' |
    grep -qx agent:claude-code &&
    gh issue edit <n> --repo "$repo" --add-label agent:claude-code
  ```

  A repo without the family — one seeded before it existed, or any repo with
  `project_management: none` — skips this. Say so once and carry on; **do not
  create the label here.** The label taxonomy belongs to
  `task setup:github-labels`, and inventing a label per repo is how vocabularies
  fork.

  **If the user approved proceeding past another agent's label**, *replace* it
  rather than adding alongside: `--add-label` alone leaves the issue advertising
  two owners, which is worse than the conflict it was meant to resolve. Remove
  the other one in the same edit and record it, so the hand-back can put it
  back:

  ```sh
  gh issue edit <n> --repo "$repo" \
    --add-label agent:claude-code --remove-label agent:codex
  ```

- **Board** — the assignee and the label are both invisible on the project
  board, which is where the work is actually watched, so move the card there
  too. `Status` only — not `Agent`, for the reason above. **Do this after the
  comment below**, not here in list order: the comment is what preserves the
  status this write destroys. The script ships with `track-work`, so
  `<track-work-dir>` is `.claude/skills/track-work` in a repo that vendors the
  skills and `ai/skills/universal/track-work` in harmon-devkit itself:

  ```sh
  <track-work-dir>/assets/set-issue-status.sh \
    --repo "$repo" --issue <n> --status "In Progress"
  ```

  Read the exit code rather than the noise: **0** applied, **3** nothing to do
  (the issue is on no board, or the board lacks the field/option) — benign,
  note it and move on, **1** the write failed, **2** it could not verify,
  usually a missing token scope (`gh auth refresh -s read:project,project`).
  Never retry a 3. A card still sitting outside `In Progress` must not be
  reported as moved.
- **Comment** via stdin with a quoted heredoc so the branch/session values are
  never re-evaluated by the shell (a branch name can contain `$(…)`). Use a
  delimiter that cannot occur in the body — quoting disables expansion, not
  termination, so a body containing a literal `EOF` line would end a
  fixed-`EOF` heredoc early:

  **Record the status you are overwriting, and record it first.**
  `--status "In Progress"` destroys whatever the card held — `Ready`,
  `Shaping`, `Next`, `Agent Queue` — and nothing anywhere else remembers it, so
  an abandoned session cannot put the issue back and has to guess. Read it with
  `--show` and write the comment **before** the board write. Ordered the other
  way, an interruption or a failed `gh issue comment` between the two loses the
  old value permanently:

  ```sh
  # 1. read (writes nothing)
  <track-work-dir>/assets/set-issue-status.sh --repo "$repo" --issue <n> --show
  # -> Status=Ready
  #    board=<owner> Project

  # 2. persist it, still before touching the board
  gh issue comment <n> --repo "$repo" --body-file - <<'CLAIM_BODY_9f3k'
  Claiming — starting implementation on branch <branch> (session <name>).

  Claim record (for `/close` — undo only what this claim added):
  - board: <board title from --show, so cleanup targets the same card>
  - prior board status: <status | "none" (unset) | "unknown" (unreadable)>
  - assignee added by this claim: <yes|no, it was already assigned to me>
  - `agent:` label added by this claim: <yes|no|n/a, repo has no such label>
  - `agent:` label displaced by this claim: <label removed on an approved
    override, or "none">
  CLAIM_BODY_9f3k

  # 3. only now move the card
  ```

  The comment is the durable record — it survives compaction, a lost session,
  and a different agent doing the hand-back.

  **"Unset" and "unknown" are different answers.** `--show` exiting 0 with no
  `Status=` line is a successful read of a card whose `Status` is genuinely
  empty — a real, restorable state. Only a *failed* call (exit 2) is unknown.
  Record `none` for the first and `unknown` for the second: `/close` restores
  an unset field by clearing it (manual — `gh project item-edit --clear`), and only has to ask the user in the second case.

After claiming, re-fetch the assignees
(`gh issue view <n> --repo "$repo" --json assignees`):
`--add-assignee` accumulates rather than arbitrates, so if someone else
claimed concurrently, surface it and coordinate before implementing. This
catches a *different* GitHub identity and nothing more — another session
running as the same user converges on the same assignee and label, and is
invisible to this check. The claim is a signal, not a lock
(`track-work` §6).

A claim is a promise to release it. `/shepherd` advances the card as the PR
moves, and `/close` flags a session that ends with an issue left at
`In Progress` and nothing in flight.

## 6. Hand off

One line — "clear to implement" (or not) — plus the corrections from the
findings that should be folded into the work.
