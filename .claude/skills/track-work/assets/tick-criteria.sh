# tick-criteria.sh — tick acceptance criteria on an issue, and refuse to do
# anything else to it.
#
# Why a script instead of `gh issue edit`: ticking has to happen *during*
# implementation, at the moment each criterion is verified, or it does not
# happen at all (SKILL.md §2, "Tick as you go"). But `gh issue edit` replaces
# the whole body, so the same command that ticks a box can retitle the issue,
# reword a criterion, or drop a section — which is why it cannot be pre-approved
# and why every tick would otherwise need a fresh approval. This narrows the
# operation to the one transition that is safe to authorise in advance:
# `- [ ]` -> `- [x]` on criteria you name, with every other byte of the body
# proven identical before the write.
#
# What it guarantees, and refuses to write without:
#   * every selector resolves to exactly one *unticked* item — an ambiguous or
#     already-ticked selector is an error, never a silent no-op;
#   * the new body differs from the old only on the selected lines, has the same
#     line count, and each changed line differs only by that one marker. A
#     criterion cannot be reworded while being ticked;
#   * the body has not changed since it was read. The window between that check
#     and the write is not detectable — GitHub offers no conditional update — so
#     this keeps it to a single command rather than pretending to close it.
#
# Checkboxes inside fenced code blocks are not criteria and are never touched.
# A failed edit is read back before it is reported, because GitHub can apply one
# and lose the response, and a retry would then find nothing left to tick.
#
# The issue must be assigned to the authenticated account. Being pre-approved,
# nothing in the permission layer scopes this command to the issue the user
# asked about — the claim is what scopes it.
#
# Usage:
#   tick-criteria.sh --repo owner/repo --issue N [--match TEXT]... [--index K]...
#                    [--dry-run]
#
#   --match TEXT   tick the one unticked item containing TEXT (case-insensitive)
#   --index K      tick the K-th unticked item, counting from 1
#   --dry-run      print what would be ticked; write nothing
#
# Set $ISSUE_BODY_DIR to read (and, in that mode, write) issue bodies as
# fixtures instead of calling the API: issue N of owner/repo is
# "$ISSUE_BODY_DIR/owner_repo__N.md". Offline tests only — it is reported on
# every run so it cannot silently swallow a real write.
#
# Exit: 0 = ticked (or dry run), 1 = refused to write (selector unresolved,
#       validation failed, or the body moved), 2 = usage/environment error.

# Enumerate the unticked items as "lineno:text", in body order.
#
# The item pattern is check-closing-keywords.sh's — unordered and ordered
# markers, any indentation, any whitespace run before the box, any depth of
# blockquote prefix — with two deliberate departures, both because this one
# writes. Fenced blocks are skipped, where that guard scans them. And the box
# must be followed by whitespace or the end of the line, as GFM requires to
# render a task item at all: `- [ ]example` is literal text, and ticking it
# would edit prose while the real criterion stayed open. The guard can safely
# over-count there; a mutation cannot. The bias inverts with the operation: a read-only guard
# is fail-closed, so a checkbox in an example counts as unfinished work; a
# command that writes must not treat an example as a criterion, or `--index 1`
# ticks a code sample and reports success while the real criterion stays open.
#
# Containment is modelled here rather than parsed — the script is deliberately
# dependency-free so consumers can vendor it with the skill, which rules out a
# CommonMark library. Modelled: fenced code blocks, indented code blocks,
# blockquotes, list items, HTML comments, and HTML blocks of CommonMark type 1
# (`pre`, `script`, `style`, `textarea`) and type 6 (the known block-tag set).
#
# Everywhere else this follows the CommonMark block algorithm, and a divergence
# is a bug rather than an accepted limit. These are the KNOWN DEPARTURES, named
# individually rather than waved at as "and other corners". State them this way
# round on purpose: nine rounds of adversarial review, local and on the PR, each
# produced constructs absent from an earlier attempt at an exhaustive list, so a
# claim that the list below is complete would not survive contact with a tenth.
# Several of those rounds found the same *class* of error one level deeper —
# conflating "a list item is open" with "a paragraph is open", or a leaf block
# with its inline spelling — which is the shape a residual bug here takes.
#
#   - HTML blocks of types 3 (`<?…?>`), 4 (`<!LETTER`) and 5 (`<![CDATA[`).
#   - HTML block type 7 (any other complete tag alone on its line). Unlike
#     type 6 it cannot interrupt a paragraph, and recognising it needs a full
#     tag parse — attribute values may contain `>`.
#   - Blockquote lazy continuation: an unquoted line directly under a quoted
#     paragraph continues it, and is enumerated here as if it had left the
#     quote. Lazy continuation inside a LIST item is modelled.
#   - Setext heading underlines (`===`). ATX headings and thematic breaks are
#     recognised as leaf blocks that close a paragraph; an `===` underline is
#     still read as prose, so an ordered list starting above 1 directly under
#     one does not open its container.
#
# The first three over-enumerate — they offer a line GitHub renders as
# something else — so prefer `--match` over `--index` on a body carrying one.
# The write gates downstream are what make any of this survivable: a mis-parse
# costs a refusal or a missed tick, never a body edited beyond one marker.
