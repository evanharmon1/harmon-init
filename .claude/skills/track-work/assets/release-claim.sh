#!/usr/bin/env bash
# release-claim.sh — release the claim markers /claim left on an issue, from
# an event instead of a session.
#
# Why: a claim is written by a session, but its release is owed after the
# merge — an event no session is guaranteed to witness (/shepherd stops before
# the merge on policy). Without an event-driven release, every claim whose
# session ends before the human merges strands: the assignee, the claim label
# (`agent:*` or `claim:*`), and the claim comment keep advertising an agent mid-flight on work
# that is finished. This script is the release: .github/workflows/
# claim-release.yml runs it on `issues closed` and on `pull_request closed`
# (unmerged), and the backfill runs it by hand. Contract and design record:
# ../references/claim-lifecycle.md.
#
# What it does, in order:
# Vocabulary: the live-claim label is migrating from the harness-named
# `agent:*` family (legacy) to the model-centric `claim:*` family
# (`claim:<family>[:<model>]`, e.g. `claim:claude`). This script recognizes
# BOTH during the rolling transition — a claim record may name either, and the
# legacy `yes` fallback sweeps every live `agent:*` AND `claim:*` label.
#
#   1. Reads the issue (state, labels, assignees) — also the trust anchor:
#      only comments authored by the repo owner or a CURRENT assignee count,
#      when selecting the claim AND when deciding it was already released.
#      Comments are attacker-writable on a public repo; a forged `Claiming —`
#      must not shadow the real claim, and a forged `Claim released —` must
#      not suppress its cleanup.
#   2. Finds the latest trusted `Claiming —` comment. None, or a later
#      trusted `Claim released —` already superseding it — exit 3. With
#      --not-after, a claim NEWER than the triggering event also exits 3:
#      replacement work that reclaimed the issue after the event is not this
#      event's to release.
#   3. Parses the comment's "Claim record" and undoes ONLY what it says the
#      claim added: the claim label (v1 records name it — `agent:*` or
#      `claim:*`; a legacy `yes` falls back to every live `agent:*`/`claim:*`
#      label), the claim author's own assignment, and — only while the issue
#      is still open — restores a displaced label. A claim with no record at all releases by
#      comment only and touches no marker. Record values are data: labels and
#      logins are validated before they become arguments, never executed.
#   4. Re-reads the comments immediately before writing and aborts (exit 3)
#      if the claim of record changed — the fetch-to-write window is where a
#      concurrent re-claim lands.
#   5. Posts the supersede comment ONLY when every marker write succeeded.
#      The comment IS the release — posting it over a surviving marker would
#      tell every future sweep the claim is settled while stale state
#      remains. A partial release exits 4 with no comment, the Actions job
#      goes red, and a re-run retries the whole release.
#
# Usage:
#   release-claim.sh --repo owner/repo --issue N --reason TEXT
#                    [--not-after ISO8601] [--dry-run]
#
# --reason lands verbatim in the fixed first line:
#   Claim released — <reason>. (Supersedes the claim record above.)
# --not-after is the triggering event's timestamp (e.g. the PR's closed_at):
#   a trusted claim created after it is left alone.
#
# Auth: GH_TOKEN with `issues: write` suffices (assignee and label edits are
# ordinary issue writes). No project scope — this script never touches boards;
# see claim-lifecycle.md for why event-driven Status was declined.
#
# Exit: 0 = released: every applicable marker cleared and the supersede
#           comment posted (or fully resolved under --dry-run),
#       1 = markers cleared but the supersede comment failed to post — the
#           release is NOT recorded; safe to re-run,
#       2 = usage/environment error, or a trusted claim whose record is
#           present but unreadable — could not verify, fail closed,
#       3 = nothing to do: no trusted claim, already superseded, newer than
#           --not-after, or the ground shifted mid-run (stderr says which),
#       4 = partial: a marker write failed; the supersede comment is
#           deliberately NOT posted, so a re-run retries the release instead
#           of reading it as already settled.
