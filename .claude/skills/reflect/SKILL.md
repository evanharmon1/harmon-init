# Reflect

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

End-of-session retrospective. Review the whole conversation, not just the
most recent work.

## 1. Gather PRs and issues

Enumerate every PR and issue that was worked on **or even referenced** during
the session. If the conversation has been compacted, the earlier context is
summarized and the enumeration is best-effort: say so explicitly, cross-check
`gh pr list --author @me` and the session's branches for work the summary may
have dropped, and note that the tables may be incomplete. Do not trust
remembered status — re-verify each one live:

- `gh pr view <n> --json state,isDraft,mergedAt,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,url,title`
- `gh issue view <n> --json state,stateReason,assignees,url,title`

Keep each reference's repository identity: a bare `#123` from another repo
must be verified with `--repo owner/repo` (or by its full URL), never against
the current repo's numbering.

## 2. Loose ends and next actions

- Uncommitted or unpushed work: `git status -sb`, and
  `git log @{u}..HEAD --oneline` (guard for branches with no upstream).
- Unresolved review threads on open PRs — `gh pr view` cannot report thread
  resolution, so use a read-only GraphQL query (this one is not pre-approved
  and will prompt):

  ```sh
  gh api graphql -f query='query($o:String!,$r:String!,$n:Int!,$c:String){
    repository(owner:$o,name:$r){pullRequest(number:$n){
      reviewThreads(first:100,after:$c){
        pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor}
        nodes{isResolved path}}}}}' \
    -F o=<owner> -F r=<repo> -F n=<pr>
  ```

  If `hasNextPage` is true, repeat with `-F c=<endCursor>` until every page
  is seen — a thread past the first 100 can still block the PR.

- TODOs introduced during the session.
- Anything promised in conversation but not done.

List each as a concrete next action.

## 3. Improvement opportunities

- Skills worth writing or updating based on friction hit this session.
- Settings, hooks, or environment improvements.
- GitHub issues worth filing — draft a title and one-line body for each, but
  do **not** create them unless asked.

## 4. Status tables

Emit exactly these two tables. Re-verified status only; short human status
text plus one emoji.
