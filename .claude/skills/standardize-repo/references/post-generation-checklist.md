# Post-Generation Checklist

Steps to run **after** `copier copy` finishes and the generated files are
committed to the repo. Generalized from harmon-init's own
`template/docs/CHECKLIST.md.jinja`; see also `docs/architecture/security.md` for
the GitHub App rationale.

Every step is tagged **[scriptable via gh]** (an agent can run it
non-interactively) or **[human-only]** (requires a browser/UI, a one-time secret
the agent must not fabricate, or a deliberate manual action per the security
model). For scriptable steps the exact `gh` command is given.

Throughout, substitute the copier answers:

- `<org>` — the `github_org` answer (defaults to the author's username; an
  **org** repo is one where `github_org != author_git_provider_username`).
- `<repo>` — the `project_slug` answer.
- `<project_type>` — one of `general`, `web-astro`, `web-app`, `iac`, `docs`.
- `<snyk_scan_schedule>` — one of `off` (default), `weekly`, or `daily`.

Run from the generated repo's root, on the default branch, after the first
push so the remote exists.

---

## 1. Local setup

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Install deps + git hooks. Installs Brewfile deps
      and, depending on copier answers, `uv sync` (Python) / `pnpm install`
      (Node) plus lefthook hooks.

  ```bash
  task install
  ```

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Confirm the full local gate passes before relying
      on CI.

  ```bash
  task verify
  ```

---

## 2. GitHub repo settings

- [ ] **[manual — GitHub UI]** Import the branch ruleset that protects `main`
      (required reviews + the `verify`/`security` status checks, plus
      `codeql-verify` for Node/Python profiles). The JSON is generated into the
      repo's `.github/`. Import it via the UI:
      **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset ▸ Import a ruleset** → select
      `.github/Branch Protection Ruleset - Protect Main.json`. To change an
      existing ruleset, edit it in the UI — don't re-import.

  > Avoid `gh api … rulesets`: `POST` is **not idempotent** (re-running creates a
  > duplicate ruleset) and both `POST`/`PUT` currently reject the `merge_queue`
  > rule (`422 Invalid rule 'merge_queue'`). The UI import handles every rule type.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Enable **Dependabot alerts**. Do NOT add a
      `dependabot.yml` — Renovate owns version updates; Dependabot is alerts-only.

  ```bash
  gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/vulnerability-alerts" --method PUT
  ```

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Enable **private vulnerability reporting**.

  ```bash
  gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/private-vulnerability-reporting" --method PUT
  ```

- [ ] **[human-only]** Install the **Renovate** GitHub App on the repo —
      <https://github.com/apps/renovate> (the generated `renovate.json` is
      pre-configured). App installation goes through GitHub's UI consent flow.

- [ ] **[human-only]** Install the **CodeRabbit** GitHub App on the repo —
      <https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai> (the generated `.coderabbit.yaml` is
      pre-configured). UI consent flow.

- [ ] **[human-only]** Set Actions **secret** `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
      (consumed by `claude-plan.yml`, `claude-implement.yml`,
      `claude-review.yml`). This is a real credential the agent must not invent;
      a human generates it with `claude setup-token` and pastes it. It **must**
      start `sk-ant-oat01-` (an OAuth token billed to the Claude **subscription**)
      — **not** `sk-ant-api03-` (a raw API key billed at pay-as-you-go **API
      rates**, an easy and expensive mix-up). Once you have it:

  ```bash
  # human supplies the token value; do not fabricate it
  gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN --repo "<org>/<repo>"
  ```

- [ ] **[human-only decision; optional]** Choose the Snyk posture recorded by
      `<snyk_scan_schedule>`:

  - `off` (default): keep Snyk manual/local through
    `task security:sast:snyk` and `task security:sca:snyk`, with `SNYK_TOKEN`
    in the local environment or 1Password. Do not create an Actions secret.
  - `weekly` or `daily`: the generated advisory `snyk-scheduled.yml` runs SAST
    and SCA only on its schedule or manual dispatch—never PR/push and never as a
    required branch check. Set the secret, run it once manually, and inspect the
    Snyk Organization Usage page:

    ```bash
    # human supplies the existing Snyk token value
    gh secret set SNYK_TOKEN --repo "<org>/<repo>"
    gh workflow run snyk-scheduled.yml --repo "<org>/<repo>"
    ```

  Prefer `weekly` as the conservative cadence. `daily` is intended for public
  repositories or projects accepted into Snyk's
  [unlimited open-source program](https://snyk.io/open-source/).
  Confirm Snyk classifies a public Git remote correctly and does not debit the
  private-test allocation; if it does, follow Snyk's
  [documented remedy](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-snyk-cli#running-out-of-tests):
  run `snyk monitor` once and set the Project's Git remote URL in Snyk. Free
  private repositories keep Semgrep CE in CI and normally use Snyk only for
  occasional local scans because local and
  scheduled private tests share the Organization-wide quota. Leave the Snyk
  GitHub App off unless deliberately adopting its PR integration; its checks are
  not required by the default ruleset. Important private repositories may
  instead evaluate paid GitHub Code Security/private CodeQL and/or paid Snyk.

- [ ] **[human-only]** Create or reuse the CI **GitHub App** `<org>-ci`, then
      set `CI_APP_CLIENT_ID` (Actions **variable**) + `CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (Actions
      **secret**). This App authenticates `release.yml` (release-please) and the
      `claude-*` workflows; minting an App-authored commit is what lets a release
      PR's required checks actually run (the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not
      retrigger CI).

  **One App per org** (or per personal account) — `<org>-ci`, e.g.
  `evanharmon1-ci` — so a leaked key is contained to one org. The App must be
  created in the GitHub UI: the app-manifest "one-click" flow can't be completed
  by a static page (the one-time `?code=` expires), so this is human-only. The
  exact permission set is checked into the generated repo as
  `.github/github-app-manifest.json`; mirror it in the form.

  - New GitHub App: org → `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/apps/new`;
    personal → `https://github.com/settings/apps/new`.
  - Name `<org>-ci`; uncheck the **Active** webhook; **"Only on this account"**;
    grant exactly these permissions and nothing more:

    | Permission | Level | Why |
    |---|---|---|
    | Contents | Read and write | commits, branches, tags, releases |
    | Pull requests | Read and write | open/update the release PR and claude PRs |
    | Issues | Read and write | claude comments/labels/updates issues |
    | Workflows | Read and write | claude may edit files under `.github/workflows/` |
    | Metadata | Read-only | required baseline |

  - Generate a private key (`.pem`) and copy the **Client ID** (the Iv-style string on the App's settings page, not the numeric App ID).
  - **Install App** → on this org → **Only select repositories** (not "All").
    **Creating the App is not enough:** an App with credentials set but *not
    installed* on the repo makes `actions/create-github-app-token` fail at runtime
    with a **404** (`Not Found`). This is the single easiest step to miss.
  - Set the variable + secret. **Scope the secret least-privilege** to the repos
    that use the App (`--visibility selected --repos`), not the whole org — the key
    can act as the App (commits, PRs, releases, workflow edits). **Pipe the `.pem`
    in**, never paste it (flattened newlines break the key):

    ```bash
    # org — scope to the repos where the App is installed
    gh secret set CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --org <org> \
      --visibility selected --repos <repo-a>,<repo-b> < path/to/app.pem
    gh variable set CI_APP_CLIENT_ID --org <org> \
      --visibility selected --repos <repo-a>,<repo-b> --body "<client-id>"

    # personal account — per-repo
    gh secret set CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --repo "<org>/<repo>" < path/to/app.pem
    gh variable set CI_APP_CLIENT_ID --repo "<org>/<repo>" --body "<client-id>"
    ```

    Caveat: re-running `--repos` **replaces** the list (evicting repos not in it) —
    re-run with the full list to add a repo, or append one with `gh api --method PUT
    /orgs/<org>/actions/secrets/CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY/repositories/{repo_id}`.

  > **Free-org caveat:** org-level Actions variables/secrets only reach **private**
  > repos on GitHub **Team/Enterprise**. On a **Free** org they read *empty* in a
  > private repo's workflows — a silent failure (e.g. an empty `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
  > made Terraform plan a resource *replacement*). On a Free org, set org-wide values
  > (including `CI_APP_*`) **per-repo** instead. Public repos are unaffected.

  See `docs/architecture/security.md` for blast-radius and rotation notes.

- [ ] **[human-only entitlement decision; scriptable via gh]** Confirm the
      visibility-appropriate SAST route. Node/Python **public** repositories run
      the generated CodeQL workflow automatically and for free—confirm a
      successful Security-tab upload; do not set a variable. Free **private**
      repositories use Semgrep CE in `build.yml`. Profiles without a generated
      CodeQL workflow use Semgrep CE at either visibility. Only after enabling
      paid GitHub Code Security for a private/internal repository, opt it into
      private CodeQL and confirm the upload:

  ```bash
  gh variable set FULL_SECURITY_SCAN --repo "<org>/<repo>" --body "true"
  ```

  The variable is a run switch, not an entitlement, and cannot disable public
  CodeQL.

- [ ] **[human-only]** (devcontainer projects) Ensure the org/user **allows
      GHCR package publishing** so the first `devcontainer-build.yml` prebuild on
      merge to main can populate `ghcr.io/<org>/<repo>-devcontainer`. The
      workflow already requests `packages: write` and logs in with
      `GITHUB_TOKEN`; org package-creation policy is a UI setting.

### Org repos only (`github_org != author_git_provider_username`)

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Create/sync the org **Project V2**. The generated
      repo ships an idempotent task; run it (needs the `project` scope —
      `gh auth refresh -s project`):

  ```bash
  task setup:github-project
  ```

  > It looks the project up by title, so it is safe to re-run and safe to run
  > from any org repo (the first run creates it, later runs only reconcile). It
  > seeds the full `Status` pipeline plus the Priority/Estimate/Product/Agent
  > fields and never deletes existing options or fields.
  > `project-automation.yml` and the `claude-*` workflows drive `Status`: the
  > task records the project id in the `ORG_PROJECT_ID` org variable those
  > workflows read (falling back to the project's title), so it no longer has to
  > be the org's project number 1. For the exact GraphQL (or to run it by hand),
  > see `scripts/setup-github-project.sh`.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Add the bot machine account
      (`<author_git_provider_username>-bot`) as a **Write** collaborator (it does
      the in-container git pushes; it cannot merge `main`):

  ```bash
  gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/collaborators/<author_git_provider_username>-bot" \
    --method PUT -f permission=push
  ```

  > The grant is only half of it — see the PAT step below. Skipping that leaves
  > the bot with access it cannot use.

- [ ] **[manual — GitHub UI]** Add this repo to the bot's **fine-grained PAT**,
      under *Repository access → Only select repositories*. There is no API for
      creating or editing a PAT. Signed in **as the bot**: **Settings → Developer
      settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens**.

  > **Effective access = min(collaborator grant, PAT permissions).** A PAT
  > delegates its owner's access and can never exceed it, and its permission set
  > is *uniform across every selected repo* — there is no per-repo matrix. So
  > per-repo granularity lives in the **collaborator grant**, not the token: to
  > narrow the bot on a repo, change the grant. Both layers are required, in
  > order — a repo missing from the list fails even though the grant exists.
  >
  > **A PAT is scoped to one resource owner.** A token for
  > `<author_git_provider_username>` cannot reach `<org>/…`, so a **new org needs
  > a new PAT**, not a new entry. Pick the org as *Resource owner*, or its repos
  > are unreachable regardless of permissions.
  >
  > **Organization permissions are org-scoped — the selected-repo list does not
  > bound them.** Grant read, never write.
  >
  > Permissions table and rationale: the generated repo's
  > `docs/architecture/branch-protection.md`. Full procedure (creating the
  > account, storing the value, verifying, rotating):

## 3. Framework scaffolding (conventions-only template)

The template ships conventions, not an application. Scaffold the framework that
matches `<project_type>`:

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** (`web-astro`) Scaffold Astro and add the standard
      stack. **Scaffold BEFORE the first push** when the repo deploys to Cloudflare
      Workers: the pre-push hook runs `astro check`, which fails on a bare repo with
      no app — so scaffold on a branch, fast-forward it into `main`, *then*
      `gh repo create --push` (never `--no-verify`).

  ```bash
  pnpm create astro@latest . --template minimal
  pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/vite vitest
  pnpm add @astrojs/react react react-dom   # if using React islands (the standard stack)
  pnpm add zod lucide
  # install the plugins the shipped eslint.config.js + prettier config expect:
  pnpm add -D eslint @eslint/js typescript-eslint eslint-plugin-astro globals
  pnpm add -D prettier prettier-config-standard prettier-plugin-astro prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
  ```

  Then move lint tooling (prettier, eslint, markdownlint-cli2, @commitlint/cli)
  into `devDependencies` and switch the generated `Taskfile.yml`'s `npx --yes`
  calls to `pnpm exec`. Review `lighthouserc.json` URLs once routes exist.

  Build-script approvals + the esbuild security floor already ship in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`allowBuilds: esbuild, sharp`, plus `workerd` when
  deploying to Workers; `overrides: esbuild >=0.28.1`) — add any other packages
  your deps need to `allowBuilds` (a pnpm 11+ setting — it replaced pnpm 10's
  `onlyBuiltDependencies`, so the shipped file needs pnpm 11+), not the
  `package.json` `pnpm` field (pnpm 10+ ignores it).

  > **Cloudflare Workers deploy:** bootstrap the Worker **once** before PR
  > previews work. A preview (`wrangler versions upload`) requires the Worker to
  > already exist, so run the production deploy first (Actions → *Release Please*
  > → *Run workflow* on `main`). See the generated `docs/guides/deploying.md`.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** (`web-app`) Scaffold a TanStack Start app (or
      vite + react) and add the standard stack:

  ```bash
  pnpm create @tanstack/start@latest   # or: pnpm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
  pnpm add -D vitest
  pnpm add zod lucide
  # shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 per their installers, e.g.:
  pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
  ```

  Move lint tooling into `devDependencies` and switch Taskfile `npx --yes` calls
  to `pnpm exec`.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** (`iac`) Lay out the IaC tree. Lint tasks for
      Ansible activate automatically once `ansible/site.yml` exists:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p terraform ansible/inventory ansible/roles
  : > terraform/main.tf
  : > terraform/variables.tf
  : > terraform/outputs.tf
  : > ansible/site.yml
  : > ansible/ansible.cfg
  ```

- [ ] **[human-only]** (`docs`) Decide the docs toolchain (plain markdown /
      Obsidian vault / static-site generator) — a judgment call, not scripted.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** (`general` / anything else) Add the project's
      primary toolchain and extend the Taskfile `build`/`test` targets
      accordingly.

---

## 4. Secrets & environment

- [ ] **[human-only]** For local `.env` needs, use **1Password Environments**
      (mounts a virtual `.env` over a UNIX pipe — values never hit disk or git)
      or `op run` / `op inject`. Commit only `.env.example`-style files.

- [ ] **[human-only]** (devcontainer projects) Devcontainer secrets: create a
      **1Password environment** with destination "Local .env file" mounted at
      `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` (and `.devcontainer/dev/devcontainer.env`),
      holding `GH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `AGENT_DECK_TELEGRAM_KEY`
      (+ `TS_AUTHKEY` for the dev profile; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is forbidden).
      `init-env.sh` only enforces the per-profile allow-list and seeds from the
      **host env** (the Coder/Codespaces path) — it does **not** call `op`. Full
      walkthrough in the generated repo's `docs/guides/devcontainers.md`.

- [ ] **[human-only]** (Coder) To run the devcontainer in Coder, create a
      workspace from the **org-level Coder devcontainer template** (not part of
      the repo — canonical example: `terraform/coder/devcontainer/` in
      harmonops/harmon-infra) with its `repo` parameter set to this repo and the
      secret parameters above (Coder passes them as host env → `init-env.sh`).
      The build pulls `<devcontainer_image>` from GHCR as a cache (private
      package ⇒ give the builder a read token; a miss only slows the first build).

---

## 5. Docs & meta

- [ ] **[human-only]** Fill in the `TODO:` markers in `README.md` and `docs/`
      (architecture diagram first) — authoring, not scripting.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Confirm README badges render once CI has run
      (Actions URLs become valid after the first workflow run):

  ```bash
  gh run list --repo "<org>/<repo>" --limit 5
  ```

- [ ] **[human-only]** Cut the initial release when ready — releases stay
      **intentional**, never automated on merge:

  ```bash
  task release:init   # v0.1.0
  ```
