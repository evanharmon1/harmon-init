  Apply the harmon-init Copier template's conventions (DevOps tooling, CI/CD, lint,
  security, git hooks, Taskfile) to a repo. Use whenever the user wants to "apply
  harmon-init", "scaffold a new repo with my conventions", "set up a new project",
  "adopt the template", "bring this repo up to my standards", "standardize this repo",
  or "audit this repo against my standards / check what's missing". Covers three
  modes: scaffolding a brand-new/empty repo, retrofitting an existing repo with git
  history, and auditing a repo for drift from the standards. Trigger it even if the
  user doesn't say the word "skill".

# Standardize Repo (apply harmon-init conventions)

Bring a repo in line with the **harmon-init** Copier template — the shared baseline
of DevOps tooling, CI/CD, linting, secrets scanning, lefthook git hooks, and a
`Taskfile.yml` task runner. harmon-init is the **template** repo of harmon-platform
(siblings: harmon-devkit, harmon-dotfiles, harmon-ops, harmon-infra); this skill is
how an agent *consumes* that template to scaffold new repos or standardize existing
ones. harmon-init is NOT an application — it is used via
[Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), so the heavy lifting is
`copier copy` / `copier update`, not hand-copying files.

## Credential boundary

Keep secret and credential-store writes human-only. Use read-only checks to confirm
that a credential is configured without revealing its value. If CI is blocked by a
missing credential, report the exact maintainer action; never create, rotate, delete,
or widen access to credentials, or weaken a workflow merely to make CI green.

## Preconditions

Verify these before doing anything; stop and tell the user if one is unmet.

- **copier** installed — `copier --version` (needs `>= 9.4.0`, per `_min_copier_version`).
- **harmon-init** cloned locally at `~/git/harmon-init` — required by **every**
  mode. If missing:
  `git clone https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init ~/git/harmon-init`.
  The one exemption is narrow: audit mode's guarded drift helper
  (`assets/diff-template.sh`) snapshots the canonical remote itself and needs no
  checkout. The rest of audit mode — the catalog comparison, which is the bulk of
  the work — reads the checkout directly as `$TEMPLATE`, and it is the *only*
  source of truth for a never-templated repo, where the drift helper cannot run
  at all.
- **task** (go-task) on PATH — `task --version` — for the verification gate.
- **yq** on PATH — reads and freezes the `.copier-answers.yml` lineage tuple.
- **gh** authenticated (`gh auth status`) — `gh api` requires a credential even on
  public repositories, so this is needed for:
  - the GitHub side-effect steps (remote create, release init);
  - **update mode's legacy-baseline branch**, taken whenever the recorded
    `_commit` is tag-valued — it reads the GitHub release record;
  - the **Code Security capability check** before selecting CodeQL on a
    private/internal repo (`mode-update.md` §3, `mode-audit.md` drift class G) —
    this one applies regardless of lineage, including full-hash baselines.

  Plain local scaffolding does not need it, and neither does **audit mode's**
  legacy-baseline recovery — that path is `git`-only (`assets/diff-template.sh`
  resolves via `git ls-remote`, never `gh api`).

## Mode routing

Detect the situation, then follow the matching reference file end to end.

| Situation | Mode | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target dir is empty / does not exist yet (new project) | **new-repo** | `references/mode-new-repo.md` |
| Target is an existing repo **with git history** (retrofit) | **adopt-existing** | `references/mode-adopt-existing.md` |
| Repo already generated from harmon-init (**v3+**, has `.copier-answers.yml`) and user wants the **latest template changes** ("update", "keep in sync", "pull latest harmon-init") | **update** | `references/mode-update.md` |
| User says "audit" / "check" / "what's missing" / "bring up to standard" / drift report | **audit** | `references/mode-audit.md` |

If it is ambiguous (e.g. a non-empty dir that is not a git repo), ask the user which
mode they want rather than guessing — `copier copy` vs `copier update` behave very
differently.

## Cardinal copier rules (read before running any copier command)

These are load-bearing. Full rationale and edge cases in `references/copier-gotchas.md`.

- **Production scaffolds use the canonical GitHub URL at a remote-verified
  release ref.** Select `HARMON_INIT_REF`, verify that exact tag against
  `origin`, peel it once to `HARMON_INIT_COMMIT`, and pass that immutable commit
  to Copier using the guarded commands in the applicable mode reference. **Then
  freeze the tuple: `--vcs-ref` does not survive into the answers file.** Copier
  derives `_commit` from `git describe --tags --always`, so a released tag lands
  in `.copier-answers.yml` instead of the peeled hash — discarding the immutable
  evidence the guard just established. Every mode that renders must promote
  `_src_path`/`_commit` to the canonical URL and `HARMON_INIT_COMMIT` afterward.
  Update
  mode must also resolve the recorded `_commit` once, require maintainer-approved
  recovery when legacy tag-only lineage lacks immutable evidence, and run every
  trusted render from a read-only offline clone through process-scoped Git URL
  rewrites.
  Prove the target descends from the resolved baseline before rendering. This
  records durable lineage that another machine can resolve without allowing a
  retag between validation and trusted template execution. A local-path
  `--vcs-ref=HEAD` render is only for a disposable
  preview/test of unreleased template work. Copier may represent dirty local work
  with a throwaway commit that does not exist on GitHub; never promote that render
  by rewriting only `_src_path`. The recorded `_src_path` and `_commit` are one
  lineage tuple: before changing a local path to the canonical URL, prove the
  recorded commit is reachable from that remote, or re-render/re-adopt from a
  released remote ref. An update must reject a non-canonical recorded source and
  pass the immutable commit derived from the remote-verified `HARMON_INIT_REF`
  so preview and apply cannot select different releases. See
  `copier-gotchas.md` gotchas 1 and 8.
- **Side-effectful answers default to `no`** in `copier.yml` (`github_remote_create`,
  `github_release_init`, `bunch_add`, `obsidian_project_add`, `run_task_install`).
  Leave them off unless the user explicitly asks; only flip them on with confirmation.
- **Run non-interactively** with `--data key=value` for known answers and
  `--defaults` for the rest, so runs are reproducible and CI-safe. Use `--trust`
  (the template has `_tasks`). Example shape:

  ```bash
  copier copy https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init.git ./new-project \
    --vcs-ref="$HARMON_INIT_COMMIT" --trust \
    --data project_name="My Project" --data project_type=general --defaults
  ```

  This is only the command shape; run the release-tag validation and derive
  `HARMON_INIT_COMMIT` in `references/mode-new-repo.md` before executing it.

- **Validate after every apply.** Re-running `copier` or changing answers can churn
  files — confirm the result with the verification step below before committing.
- **Optimize for regular rolling updates, not every historical migration path.**
  harmon-init-managed repositories are expected to stay near the current release.
  Review new answers against the target repository and pass the decisions
  explicitly. Do not add or expect permanent version-pair migrations for unusual
  gaps or customizations; reconcile those case by case in the downstream PR.

The asked questions live in `~/git/harmon-init/copier.yml` (e.g. `project_name`,
`project_slug`, `project_description`, `github_org`, `project_type`
[general / web-astro / web-app / iac / docs], `snyk_scan_schedule`
[off / weekly / daily], `include_terraform`, `include_ansible`, `ci_runner`,
`license`, `use_codeql`, `codeql_languages`, `use_release_please`, `devcontainer`,
`use_codex_review`, `use_codex_cloud_review`, `use_coderabbit`, `git_init`).
Read that file to
confirm names/choices/defaults before scaffolding — do not invent answers.

## Standards catalog

The authoritative, itemized list of what "standardized" means — every tool, config
file, Taskfile target, hook, and CI workflow the template provides, and how to check
each — is **`references/standards-catalog.md`**. The audit mode and any manual
retrofit work off that catalog. Treat the generated template output (and that
catalog) as the source of truth, not memory.

## Verification

After a template apply or update, if `.skills-sync.yaml` exists, refresh and verify
the managed skills before running the repository gate:

```bash
task sync:skills
task verify:skills
task verify:skills:offline
```

After applying any mode, run the bundled check:

```bash
assets/verify-applied.sh <target-repo-dir>
```

It confirms the expected files/tooling landed and then runs the repo's own gate
(`task verify` = the repo's fast check/build/validate/guard set; `task check` for lint only;
`task install:hooks` to wire lefthook). Report what passed and surface any gaps
against `references/standards-catalog.md`. Never bypass hooks (`--no-verify` is
prohibited); commit on a feature branch and open a PR — no direct commits to `main`.
When the work includes a PR, watch every required check to a terminal green result
and inspect every review thread after each push. Apply feedback you agree with and
reply with a concrete repository-specific rationale when you disagree. Never merge;
report the reviewed, green PR for human handoff.
