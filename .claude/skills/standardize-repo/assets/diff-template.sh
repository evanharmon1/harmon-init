# diff-template.sh — show how a repo's template-owned files differ from a fresh
# harmon-init render, so the agent can find missed template improvements.
#
# Renders harmon-init using the TARGET repo's own .copier-answers.yml, then
# compares the WHOLE render against the repo and reports:
#   • DRIFT    — content differences. In the curated template-owned-files.txt set
#                (mapping .yml<->.yaml) a listed file may differ because the repo
#                legitimately customized it (terraform tasks, a custom status
#                section) OR because it's missing template improvements (the
#                recurring status.sh / lint-hygiene / bootstrap class). The same
#                DRIFT is reported — tagged "uncurated" — for rendered files the
#                manifest does NOT list: the manifest is hand-maintained, covers
#                58 entries and no prose at all, so comparing content only within
#                it left most of the render unchecked. A rendered path the repo
#                HAD was skipped outright, however far it had diverged.
#   • MODE     — executable-bit differences, in the curated set and the sweep
#                alike. Copier can preserve content while a manual copy silently
#                drops `+x`, leaving a generated script present but unusable.
#                Symlinks are exempt: the bit belongs to the link target.
#                Reported INDEPENDENTLY of the content class and always gating,
#                CO-OWNED and IGNORED included — the exec bit is structural, and
#                nobody "owns" a generated script that stopped being runnable.
#   • MISSING  — template files the repo lacks ENTIRELY. This scan is
#                manifest-INDEPENDENT (it walks the whole render), because the
#                manifest is hand-maintained and lags the template — a file added
#                after the last manifest edit, or dropped by a hand-reconciled
#                `copier update`, would otherwise slip through silently. (.gitkeep
#                dir-stubs are listed as benign ABSENT, not flagged as drift.)
#                A tracked file deleted only from the working tree is compared
#                from the index, so an unstaged/transient delete is not reported
#                as drift; once the deletion is staged it is real MISSING. That
#                includes a `git rm --cached` whose working-tree copy SURVIVES:
#                present in HEAD, gone from the index, so the next commit deletes
#                a template-owned file. The surviving copy otherwise compared
#                clean — or collected the IGNORED exemption, since dropping the
#                index entry is what makes check-ignore start calling it
#                ignored — and the deletion went unreported.
#   • EQUIV    — a mature nested Terraform layout, or a renumbered/established ADR
#                log, intentionally replacing a generated seed path. Benign.
#   • CO-OWNED — the template SEEDS the file but the repo owns its PROSE
#                (AGENTS.md and its symlink aliases, README, the *.md under
#                docs/ and specs/, the devcontainer zshrc, …). The docs/ and
#                specs/ globs are filtered to Markdown deliberately: a build
#                script or generated config under a docs tree is not prose
#                anybody rewrote, and letting it inherit this exemption for its
#                directory alone is the opposite of safe-by-default. Non-prose
#                there gates as ordinary uncurated DRIFT.
#                Divergence is the expected steady state
#                there, so these are reported PRESENCE-ONLY: no diff is printed,
#                not even under --show, and their CONTENT never affects the exit
#                status (a MODE finding on one still gates — see above).
#                Their value is the INVERSE signal — a CO-OWNED line that
#                DISAPPEARS after a `copier update` means the repo's copy is now
#                byte-identical to the template's, i.e. the customizations were
#                clobbered.
#   • IGNORED  — the repo's copy is UNTRACKED and BOTH the repo and the TEMPLATE
#                ignore the path (a resolved .envrc and friends). Presence-only
#                for the same reason plus a harder one: a resolved local config
#                can hold real secrets, so its diff is never printed. Its
#                content never affects the exit status.
#                The template's declaration is what grants this, never the
#                repo's habits. A repo that adds .vscode/ to its OWN .gitignore
#                has said nothing about the artifact — every other clone still
#                renders it — so a path the repo ignores and the template TRACKS
#                is gating DRIFT, tagged "repo-ignored, but the template tracks
#                this file". Its body is still withheld: somebody marked that
#                path local-only, and being wrong about whether it is drift does
#                not make its contents safe to print.
# Ignore rules drive two INDEPENDENT axes, because "does this gate?" and "is
# this safe to print?" are different questions:
#   – CLASSIFICATION follows repo STATE and then the TEMPLATE's declaration.
#     Only an UNTRACKED file that BOTH sides ignore is the informational IGNORED
#     class; a TRACKED one gates like any other file, ignore rules or not,
#     because tracked content is template-relevant, and a repo-only ignore gates
#     too, because ignoring a file is a habit rather than a statement about the
#     artifact. `git check-ignore` answers the tracked half exactly — it
#     consults the index, so it never calls a tracked file ignored — and a
#     scratch repo built from the RENDER's .gitignore files answers the other.
#     That scratch repo carries only the ignore files GIT ITSELF would honor: a
#     symlinked .gitignore is one git refuses to follow, so the paths it lists
#     are not ignored in any real clone and must not collect this class.
#   – WITHHOLDING follows the PATH alone, under the UNION of both rule sets
#     (`check-ignore --no-index` on the repo side so the index cannot mask the
#     pattern). NO diff this script prints for a pattern-matching path is ever
#     emitted — CURATED AND SWEPT ALIKE, and not even for a finding that gates.
#     Being on the hand-maintained manifest says the template owns the path, not
#     that the repo's copy is safe to echo: the manifest lists
#     .claude/settings.json, exactly the shape whose local copy holds
#     credentials. A repo can also `git add -f` a resolved config, and tracking
#     it makes that file reviewable, not publishable — or simply FAIL to ignore
#     what the template declares local, which is the same secret in a less
#     careful repo. A one-line note replaces the body. Its render-side evaluator
#     is the WIDER of the two: a symlinked .gitignore enforces nothing in a real
#     clone, but the template still MARKED those paths local-only, and being
#     unenforceable is no reason to print them.
# CLASSIFICATION requires the target to be a repository root of its OWN. A plain
# directory nested inside somebody else's work tree gets no IGNORED class,
# because inheriting a stranger's ignore rules would silently downgrade real
# drift; everything there falls through to gating DRIFT. The render half of
# WITHHOLDING still applies there — it needs no work tree, and a
# template-declared-local body is no safer to print for having landed in a
# directory that is not a repo.
# Symlinks are compared by LINK TARGET, not by content: the template ships
# CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, and .github/copilot-instructions.md as symlinks to
# AGENTS.md (_preserve_symlinks), so content-diffing them would report a single
# AGENTS.md divergence four times over. A path that is a symlink on one side and
# a regular file on the other, or a link pointing somewhere else, is a
# STRUCTURAL divergence and always gates — the CO-OWNED/IGNORED exemptions cover
# content, because prose is what a repo owns; nobody "owns" an alias that stopped
# being an alias, and the finding is one line of metadata, not a diff to withhold.
# The CURATED loop enforces this too. It used a bare `diff -q`, which FOLLOWS a
# symlink, so a manifest-listed regular file swapped for a link to a
# byte-identical referent passed clean there while the sweep gated the identical
# shape; both now share one comparison routine so they cannot diverge again.
# This is a REVIEW AID for apply/update/audit, not a pass/fail gate. For each
# DRIFT/MISSING, inspect and reconcile — pull template improvements in via
# `copier update`, keep legit local customizations.

# --- What the target actually is ---------------------------------------------
# Settled once, before anything resolves a path inside it, because three
# separate guarantees below hang off the answer: the index fallback, the IGNORED
# class, and the repo-side half of the withholding probe.
#
# The question is whether the target IS a repository root of its own, not
# whether it sits inside one. `rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` answers the
# second and reads true for a plain directory nested in somebody else's work
# tree — the audit accepts a plain directory, and the hermetic tests point it at
# exactly that shape — so every consumer of the looser test was quietly
# answering about whatever repository happens to contain the temp dir. Compare
# the detected toplevel against the target's own path instead, normalizing both
# with `cd` + `pwd -P`: `$target` above is a LOGICAL pwd while git always
# reports a resolved one, so on macOS's symlinked /var a real repo root would
# never match otherwise (`realpath` is not portable to those hosts).
#
# When they differ the target is treated as the plain directory it is: no index
# fallback, no IGNORED class, no repo-side pattern probes — disk-only presence
# semantics, and everything falls through to gating DRIFT. A plain directory has
# neither ignore rules nor an index of its own, and borrowing a stranger's is
# worse than surfacing the drift. The RENDER-side probe is unaffected and still
# withholds bodies here: it asks what the template declared, which no property
# of the target can change.
#
# `rev-parse --show-toplevel` has THREE outcomes and the first version of this
# collapsed the last two: it succeeded, it said "this is not a repository", or
# it could not tell (dubious ownership, unreadable metadata, a malformed .git).
# Reading "could not tell" as a plain directory is fail-OPEN — it skips the repo
# half of the withholding probe, so a repo-only-ignored secret would print under
# --show precisely because git could not read the repo. LC_ALL=C pins the
# message being matched; git localizes its output otherwise.

# --- Shared comparison machinery ---------------------------------------------
# Everything from here to the curated loop is used by BOTH loops. It lived below
# the curated loop while only the sweep needed it, which is precisely how the

# gated symlink swaps and withheld ignore-matched diffs, and the manifest — the
# more curated, more load-bearing set — did neither.

# The TEMPLATE's own ignore rules, evaluated in a scratch repo built from the
# .gitignore files the RENDER ships. This is the authority on whether a rendered
# file is meant to be local-only, and the repo's rules are not: a repo that adds
# `.vscode/` to its own .gitignore was silencing real drift on a template
# artifact every other clone still gets. Ignoring something is a habit a repo
# can acquire for its own reasons; the template DECLARING a path local is a
# statement about the artifact.
#
# `git init` in the workdir is the script's existing idiom (the guarded clone
# does more), but two things have to be shut off or the evaluator answers "what
# does this MACHINE ignore" — the very question it exists to stop asking. An
# empty --template dir keeps `init.templateDir`/`~/.git-template` from seeding
# an info/exclude, and core.excludesFile=/dev/null keeps the auditor's personal
# ignore file (and the XDG default) out of the answer.
#
# Every failure here is fatal rather than a fallback. "Could not build the
# evaluator" and "the template declares nothing local" are different facts, and
# collapsing them means a broken setup silently downgrades every IGNORED path to
# a printable one — the exact direction this whole class of guarantee must not
# fail in.
#
# TWO evaluators, because the render's ignore files answer two different
# questions and a SYMLINKED .gitignore splits them apart. Git refuses to follow
# one — it reports `unable to access '.gitignore'` and the listed paths come out
# untracked-and-not-ignored — so in a freshly generated repo such a file
# enforces nothing:
#   • CLASSIFICATION must match git, or the informational IGNORED class is
#     granted to a path every real clone treats as tracked, quietly downgrading
#     drift on the strength of rules that never applied. Regular files only.
#   • WITHHOLDING must not, because it asks whether somebody MARKED this path
#     local-only, and a template that wrote `.envrc` into its ignore rules said
#     so whether or not git enforces the link. Dropping those rules is the one
#     direction this guarantee may never fail in: it prints the body. Symlinked
#     ones included, resolved through `cp`.
# A `-type f` walk fed BOTH answers from the regular files alone, so a template
# shipping its rules through a symlink printed the very bodies it declared
# local.

# entry is what makes `check-ignore` start calling it ignored. Either way the
# audit reports nothing while the very next commit DELETES a template-managed
# file. Detect the state directly: present in HEAD, absent from the index.
#
# Reported as MISSING, which is the contract index_variant already sets: an
# unstaged delete is compared from the index and stays quiet, a STAGED delete is
# real MISSING. `git rm --cached` is a staged delete whose worktree copy happens
# to survive — the commit removes the file just the same — so it earns that
# established class rather than a new one.
#
# Deliberately WITHOUT the non-adoption pointer the other two MISSING lines
# carry (copier-gotchas.md §9). That gotcha is about a path the repo LACKS,
# which the three-way merge reads as your own deletion and never restores. Here
# the file is in HEAD and its worktree copy is still on disk: there is nothing
# for an update to restore, and the fix is to reconcile the staged deletion, not
# to adopt a template file. The guarded update's classifier agrees by
# construction — its repo-presence test is `test -e`/`test -L`, so the surviving
# copy produces no non-adoption row at all, and pointing an operator at a report
# that deliberately omits this path would misdirect. Commit the deletion and the
# path becomes genuinely absent, at which point the ordinary MISSING lines
# report it and the §9 pointer is finally the true one.
#
# Both probes are THREE-valued and were read as two, exactly like the ignore
# probes before them: `cat-file -e "HEAD:$p"` exits 128 — not 1 — for a path
# that is simply absent from HEAD, so "absent" and "the probe failed" were
# already indistinguishable by exit code, and `ls-files --error-unmatch`
# collapses "untracked" into the same nonzero. An unreadable object store or a
# corrupt index therefore answered "nothing is staged for removal" and the
# staged deletion of a template-owned file went unreported. `ls-tree` and a bare
# `ls-files` separate the two cleanly instead: rc 0 with EMPTY output is the
# real "not there", and any nonzero rc is a probe error that stops the run with

# CO-OWNED — files the template SEEDS but whose prose the repo owns. The
# template's copy is a starting point that every repo rewrites, so byte drift is
# the expected steady state and printing the diff would be pure noise. Surfacing
# is therefore PRESENCE-ONLY: you learn THAT the repo's copy still diverges,
# never how. That inverse reading is the useful one — a CO-OWNED line that
# disappears after a `copier update` means the repo's copy went byte-identical
# to the template's, i.e. the customizations were clobbered.
#
# The `docs/`/`specs/` branch below — and ONLY that branch — is duplicated by
# the guarded update's non-adoption classifier (mode-update.md §1, the
# `nonadoption-classify` markers), as `nonadoption_is_doc_prose`. What
# must agree is the whole shape, not just the two globs: the Markdown-only filter
# is load-bearing there too, because a copy that kept the bare `docs/*` would
# file a missing generated asset as somebody's owned prose and annotate it as
# prose the repo owns. Over there the absence is still TABLED — §5 rows it with
# a `co-owned-prose` note rather than collapsing it out of the report — so what
# the duplicate decides is the NOTE, not whether the operator sees the path.
# Change one, change the other.
#
# The rest of this list is intentionally NOT mirrored there, and the asymmetry is
# the point. Co-ownership is a CONTENT exemption — this script withholds a diff
# because the repo's prose is expected to differ — and absence is not content.
# Over there the question is whether a file the repo does not have was declined
# on purpose, which no amount of prose ownership answers: a missing AGENTS.md or
# LICENSE earns a disposition row. Only the two documentation trees collapse
# there, and only because a repo carries tens of them.
#
# Keep these globs TIGHT. Anything the template grows that is not listed here
# falls through to a visible, gating uncurated DRIFT, which is the safe default:
# a new template file nobody has classified should be seen, not silently
# tolerated. Case globs are not path-aware — `*` matches `/` — which cuts both
# ways: `docs/*` reaches `docs/architecture/README.md` at any depth as intended,
# but it also reached every NON-prose artifact under those trees, handing a
# generated script or config the presence-only exemption purely for living in a
# docs directory. The class is about PROSE the repo rewrites, so the two tree
