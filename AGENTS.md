# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub
Copilot, Codex, etc.) working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` are symlinks to this file — edit only `AGENTS.md`.

## Project Overview

Harmon Init is a **Copier project template** that scaffolds new repos with
pre-configured DevOps tooling, CI/CD, linting, security checks, git hooks, and task
runners — and can also be applied to existing repos to standardize them. This is NOT
an application; it is a template repository used via the
[Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) templating tool.

Repo: https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init — see
[docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the documentation map,
[docs/architecture/README.md](docs/architecture/README.md) for the architecture,
and [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for design/UX intent.

## Hard Rules

Non-negotiable, regardless of any autonomy granted elsewhere in this file:

- **Never write to a password manager or credential store unprompted.** Do not
  create, modify, archive, or delete anything in 1Password (items, fields,
  vaults — via the `op` CLI or any other means), OS keychains, or any other
  secret store unless the user explicitly requested that specific write in the
  current conversation. Even when asked, restate exactly what will be written
  and get confirmation before executing — announcing intent and proceeding in
  the same turn is not consent. Read operations (`op read`, `op item list`,
  `op inject` over existing references) are fine.
- **Never make generated output depend on paid or trial-only SaaS by default.**
  Any third-party service that requires an account, app installation, trial, or
  payment must be an explicit Copier opt-in that defaults off, with its free-tier
  and private-repository limitations documented next to the question.
- **Never reference harmon-dotfiles or chezmoi in shipped output.** harmon-init,
  harmon-devkit, and harmon-infra are independent of the personal dotfiles repo
  and of chezmoi: nothing they ship — here, everything under `template/` plus
  the consumer-facing text in `copier.yml` — may name either or hardcode a path
  into somebody's dotfiles checkout (`~/.dotfiles/…` leaks the same setup
  without naming the repo), and none of them may require dotfiles to be
  installed, present, or accommodated. A consumer
  cannot read that repo, so rationale belongs in harmon-init rather than cited
  offsite, and content this repo owns is never described as kept "in sync" with
  it. The permitted coupling is one-way and optional: harmon-dotfiles may pull
  from these repos at a pinned tag; they never point back. Root-only mentions
  that ship to nobody (the sibling-repo lists, the "related repos" tables)
  create no dependency and are fine — which is why
  `test:template-independence`, the guard that enforces this, scans `template/`
  and not the whole repo.

## harmon-platform

One of five repos in **harmon-platform** (Evan's developer & DevOps platform + homelab):
[**harmon-init**](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init) (this repo — the template),
[harmon-devkit](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-devkit) (boilerplates/scripts/AI assets),
[harmon-dotfiles](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-dotfiles) (chezmoi dotfiles),
[harmon-ops](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-ops) (machine setup),
[harmon-infra](https://github.com/harmonops/harmon-infra) (homelab IaC). See the README for the full table.

Applying or auditing these standards against another repo is driven by the
**`standardize-repo`** Claude skill in harmon-devkit
(`ai/skills/repo/standardize-repo`): it wraps `copier` to scaffold a new repo,
adopt the template into an existing one, or audit a repo for drift — and carries
the authoritative repo-conventions catalog.

## Two-Layer Architecture

1. **Root level** — Config for developing/maintaining the template itself
   (`Taskfile.yml`, `lefthook.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, etc.). The root layer
   dogfoods the same conventions the template generates.
2. **`template/` directory** — The Copier template root (`_subdirectory: template`
   in `copier.yml`). Everything here becomes the generated project. Files ending in
   `.jinja` have variables substituted; jinja conditionals in file/directory names
   control inclusion.

Root lint tasks deliberately exclude `template/` (jinja files are not valid
YAML/Markdown). The **rendered** output is validated by `task test:template:*`.

**Dogfood parity — edit both layers in lockstep.** Most root files have a
`template/` counterpart they are the rendered form of (e.g.
`.devcontainer/Dockerfile` ↔ `template/[% if devcontainer %].devcontainer[% endif %]/Dockerfile`,
`.github/workflows/devcontainer-build.yml` ↔ its `…devcontainer-build.yml….jinja`).
A change to one MUST be applied to the other in the same PR, or the template and
the dogfood drift — the repo stops practicing what it ships, and `task
test:template` will not catch it (it validates the *rendered* template against
itself, not against the root copy). The root form is the template rendered with
harmon-init's own answers (e.g. `[[ ci_runner_labels ]]` → `[ "ubuntu-latest" ]`),
and template-only logic (`[% if … %]`, `${VERSION}` arg substitution) collapses to
its concrete value. When you touch a templated file, grep for the sibling and edit
both.

**The answers the root layer is a render of are checked in** at
`.dogfood-answers.yml`. It is NOT a `.copier-answers.yml` — harmon-init is the
template, so it has no copier operation of its own and `copier update` can never
target it. When the root adopts (or drops) a template option, change that file in
the same PR, or the drift tooling below reports noise instead of drift.

Three checks cover the two layers, in increasing looseness:

| Check | Scope | Gate? |
|---|---|---|
| `task test:dogfood-parity` | **verbatim** twins (no `.jinja`) — byte-equality | yes (`verify` + CI) |
| `task test:dogfood-structure` | **jinja** twins — every rendered heading/task exists in the root copy | yes (`verify` + CI) |
| `task audit:dogfood` | **jinja** twins — full text diff | no, a report |

Verbatim twins are copied into generated repos byte-for-byte, so a fix applied to
only one side fails the parity gate instead of silently shipping stale content
downstream. Jinja twins can't be byte-compared — the root copy is a render and
legitimately diverges in prose — so the gate is narrowed to *structure*: if the
template grows a section or a task, the root should have gained one too. That
catches the direction drift actually travels (you edit `template/` to ship a fix
to consumers, and nothing fails when the root copy is forgotten); it does **not**
catch changes inside a task body or paragraph. For those, run `task
audit:dogfood` — before a release, or whenever a change spans both layers — and
read the diff. Intentional divergences are allowlisted, **with reasons**, in each
script.

The **shared skills** are vendored into `.claude/skills` (so the devcontainer and
cloud claude-* workflows can use them); the canonical copies live in harmon-devkit
under `ai/skills/`. The root repo dogfoods the same pinned skills sync the
template ships: `.skills-sync.yaml` pins a released harmon-devkit tag,
`task sync:skills` vendors the `universal` and `repo` categories — the
dev-workflow session skills plus `standardize-repo` — into `.claude/skills`, and
CI/pre-push run `task verify:skills` / `verify:skills:offline` as drift checks.
Keep the category list in step with `skill_categories` in `.dogfood-answers.yml`,
or `task audit:dogfood` reports a permanent root/template difference.

Bumping that pin after a harmon-devkit release is **automated**: the root-only
`.github/workflows/sync-harmon-devkit.yml` (→ `task sync:devkit-release` →
`scripts/sync-devkit-release.sh`) validates the released tag, rewrites both
pins, re-vendors, verifies, and opens or updates ONE rolling
`bot/sync-harmon-devkit` PR. It never merges anything — both repositories keep
their intentional release gates. To trigger or recover by hand, send the
dispatch (`gh api repos/evanharmon1/harmon-init/dispatches -f
event_type=harmon-devkit-released -f 'client_payload[tag]=vX.Y.Z'`) or run
`task sync:devkit-release -- vX.Y.Z` locally. See
[docs/architecture/ci-cd.md](docs/architecture/ci-cd.md).

```

`check` is deliberately kept fast (lint only) so editors, git hooks, and AI
agents can run it on every change without getting bogged down. `verify` is the
definition-of-done gate — check + the quick Taskfile/hook/parity guards + this
repo's test tier, which renders the whole template via `test:template` and is
therefore inherently heavier than a generated repo's (the Foreman v2 vocabulary:
verify = check + build + test). `ci` is the full pipeline — everything CI runs
(`verify`, the network skills-drift check, the devcontainer permission assert,
`security`) — so you can reproduce a CI run locally on demand instead of waiting
on a PR. Keep it that way: a check the build workflow **gates on** and that can
run locally belongs in `ci` too, or the "mirror" quietly stops being one. The
one carve-out: a check that needs **CI-only infrastructure** (a browser install,
a service container, credentials that only exist on a runner) stays out of `ci`
and is documented as an exception rather than being faked locally.

**Foreman** (`taskfiles/foreman.yml`, `.foreman.toml`) is the deterministic
supervisor for milestone-driven agent dispatch: explicit arming via
`foreman:*` labels (the only attributable mode — v2 refuses issue-field
arming because GitHub exposes no actor for field changes), hardened
doneness, a strict
write contract, and **never a merge**. The CLI lives in
[ponderousdev/foreman](https://github.com/ponderousdev/foreman) (spec, ADRs,
and architecture docs there); this repo pins a released tag via
`FOREMAN_VERSION` and runs it through `uvx` — no source is vendored (ADR 0002
records the v1 in-repo design this superseded). The wrapper and config ship
to generated repos, so they are two-layer twins. Foreman's own PRs follow
foreman's lifecycle, not the Dev Loop below: it opens non-draft PRs under
its own verify gate and marks green ones with a `ready-to-merge` label —
humans still do every merge. On this public repo, D4 classifies every unit
`untrusted-input`, so **dispatch refuses under the local runner by design**
(plan / vet / status / preflight all work) until an isolated runner ships.

## Dev Loop

Bias toward shipping: drive every change to a PR instead of stopping at a green
local diff. Work in small, PR-sized units, and move to the next stage on your
own — a PR handed to a human is the default deliverable, not something to ask
permission for.

**The draft PR is the workbench.** GitHub reports drafts and non-drafts alike as
`OPEN`, so "open PR" says nothing about whose turn it is. These three states do:

- **Draft PR** — the agent's workbench. Implementation, CI, bot review, and
  shepherd fixes are still in progress. Nobody is waiting on a human.
- **Ready-for-review PR** — non-draft. The automated lifecycle is complete and
  the change is handed to a human. Reaching it is a gate, not a judgement call.
- **Merged PR** — always a separate human decision. Agents never merge.

```text
preflight/claim → implement → task verify → task challenge → task review
  → task ci → create DRAFT PR → shepherd the draft (CI, deferred findings,
  reviewers) → readiness gate → mark ready for review → human review
  → human merge
```

Creating the draft is a phase transition, not a terminal state, and every stop
short of the readiness gate leaves the PR **draft** with a blocker report — a
non-draft PR must always mean the automated work is done.

- **Branch** — feature branch off `main`; never commit directly to `main`.
- **Edit + `task check`** — the fast inner loop; run it constantly and fix
  lint immediately. (Remember dogfood parity: template twins in the same
  change.)
- **`task verify`** — when the change feels done, loop edit → verify until
  green; verify is the definition-of-done gate (includes the render matrix).
- **`task challenge`** — adversarial second-model review. Adjudicate per
  "Second-Model Review" below, fix confirmed findings, re-run `task verify`,
  then **re-run `task challenge`**. The stage passes only when a re-run comes
  back with **no confirmed P0 or P1 findings** — fixing the findings is not
  the exit condition, a clean pass is. **P2s do not gate this stage**: carry
  them to the PR (see "Deferring P2s" below). This loop is
  **self-referential** — the fixes you make in response to a round become the
  next round's input, so it can generate its own work indefinitely — and that
  is what the cap defends against: max **4** challenge → fix → re-challenge
  rounds; if P0/P1 findings persist, stop and escalate to Evan.
  "Between rounds, check what the findings are about" below is how you catch
  the loop feeding on itself before the cap does.
  A `task challenge` round is long — 5–15 minutes is ordinary, past most
  agents' tool-call timeouts — so **run it in the background and poll**
  instead of blocking one call on it. Growing output means running, not hung;
  relaunching a live run only doubles the cost. Re-challenge with a bare
  `task challenge` — it covers the branch's commits *and* the working tree,
  so an uncommitted fix cannot narrow the re-run to itself; an explicit
  `--base`/`--uncommitted` reviews one half only. Committing each round's
  fixes first is still tidier, not load-bearing. Details:
  [docs/guides/codex-review.md](docs/guides/codex-review.md) ("Duration and
  backgrounding").
- **`task review`** — verification-checkpoint review; same adjudication, same
  P0/P1 clean-pass exit condition, the same self-referential shape and so the
  same reason for a cap, and the same background-and-poll handling, with its
  own max **4** rounds.
- **`task ci`** — the full CI mirror; fix anything it catches.
- **Open the draft PR** — conventional commit, push the branch,
  **`gh pr create --draft`** with a clear what/why/verification summary (mind
  the `template/` → `fix:`/`feat:` title rule below). Then fetch
  `headRefOid,isDraft` and require both the SHA you pushed and
  `isDraft == true`: a non-draft result is not the normal publication path, so
  reconcile it before going further.
- **Git transport** — pushes authenticate over HTTPS via `gh`. Provisioned hosts
  and the devcontainers rewrite GitHub SSH URLs to HTTPS via `url.insteadOf` so
  that git never needs an SSH agent: a headless container has none, forwarding
  one into an interactive container is lockout-prone, and `gh` already holds an
  HTTPS credential that works for both. Never work around an SSH failure by
  pushing to a raw `https://…` URL — a URL push bypasses the named remote and
  leaves stale tracking refs. On an unprovisioned host, force the helper
  and the rewrite against the *named* remote:
  `git -c credential.helper= -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential' -c url."https://github.com/".insteadOf="git@github.com:" -c url."https://github.com/".insteadOf="ssh://git@github.com/" -c url."https://github.com/".insteadOf="ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/" -c url."https://github.com/".insteadOf="ssh://git@ssh.github.com/" push`
  (a credential helper only applies to HTTPS, and `insteadOf` is prefix
  matching — every SSH form needs its own mapping, hence all four).
- **Shepherd the draft to ready for review (`/shepherd`, max 4 rounds).**
  `gh pr create --draft` returning is
  the trigger for this stage, not the end of the work — enter it deliberately
  instead of judging for yourself when the PR is finished. The PR stays draft
  for the whole stage; only the readiness gate below may promote it.
  `/shepherd` is the
  procedure, and it is **user-invocable only**
  (`disable-model-invocation: true`): an agent enters the stage by reading
  `.claude/skills/shepherd/SKILL.md` and following it, not by calling a slash
  command it cannot call. Start by
  re-reading the **unchecked** entries under `## Deferred findings` in the PR
  description — those P2s are open work, not a changelog; tick each one off
  in the body as you settle it. Then watch CI
  (`gh pr checks <n> --watch`) and incoming bot/human reviews. When a check
  fails or a review lands findings, treat the findings as hypotheses: verify
  them against the code, fix only what's confirmed, explain rejections in a
  PR comment, push the fix commit, and watch again. **This is where P2s are
  settled** — the ones the PR description defers here plus anything the PR
  reviewers raise: fix, decline with reasoning, or file as a follow-up issue,
  but do not leave them unaddressed. Shepherd-round fixes must pass `task
  verify` before each push; the local challenge/review loops are not
  re-entered — the post-push cloud/bot review is the second-model check at
  this stage.
  **Require a current-head Codex result.** On initial shepherd entry and
  immediately after every fix push, capture the PR's current `headRefOid` and
  the head's push time, then post `@codex review`. Record the request time and
  the comment ID returned for that trigger. Poll PR reactions, top-level
  comments, reviews, and inline review comments; fetch trigger reactions by
  that exact comment ID. A Codex result is terminal for that captured head only
  when it is either: a clean review or top-level comment authored by GitHub
  actor ID `199175422` (`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`, type `Bot`) whose
  `Reviewed commit:` identifies that head; a fresh 👍 from that bot on that
  exact trigger comment, created after both the head push and the review
  request, with no newer contradictory bot result; or review findings authored
  by that bot which identify that head and must be adjudicated before the
  cycle can become clean. Earlier comments, reviews,
  inline findings, and reactions never count for a newer head. A 👀 is pending,
  not success; if it disappears without a terminal result, the attempt is
  incomplete.
  Give each attempt a full 10–15 minute window. If the first attempt is
  incomplete, post `@codex review` once more for the same head and run one more
  full window, recording and using the new trigger comment ID. If both attempts
  are incomplete, stop and escalate without reporting green. Waiting and the
  one allowed re-trigger do not consume a shepherd fix round. Immediately
  before accepting the result or reporting green, fetch `headRefOid` and all
  four review surfaces again; a changed head invalidates the result and starts
  a new current-head cycle.
  Shepherd is **externally driven** — CI results and other people's comments
  are its input, so it cannot manufacture a round on its own. A round is one
  fix push, or one no-change cycle where everything is answered and nothing
  needs fixing; waiting on CI or a reviewer is never a round, and this cap is
  independent of any other stage's. What it bounds is other people's findings,
  not self-generated work. It is not wholly immune, though — a reviewer can
  flag the fix your *last* round pushed, so if the rounds start circling your
  own patches, step back and ask whether the findings are about the change you
  set out to make or about a previous round's fix. Whether anything more has
  landed is settled by "Checks green is a non-terminal state" below, not by
  the absence of an immediate reply. Stopping one stage's loop is never a
  decision about another's:
  **a decision to stop one loop does not transfer to another**,
  because each is bounded for its own reason. "We have looped enough" is a
  judgement about one loop's self-generated work, and carrying it here skips
  this stage instead of bounding it, leaving the PR with reviews unanswered.
  The converse also holds: stopping to **escalate** something you cannot
  resolve halts the whole change rather than one loop, so it is not a licence
  to move on to the next stage either — a persistent P0/P1 at the challenge or
  review cap means wait for Evan, not open the PR anyway.
  If checks still fail or findings remain after 4 rounds, stop and
  summarize what's unresolved on the PR for Evan.
  Where a **vendored** skill (`/shepherd`)
  states a different cap or exit condition, **this file wins** — the skills
  are synced from harmon-devkit on its own release cadence and can lag a
  policy change made here.
- **Checks green is a non-terminal state.** Reporting "all checks pass"
  without having polled reviews and inline comments is not a handoff — it is
  the middle of the shepherd stage. Bot and human reviews land *after* checks
  settle, so `gh pr checks --watch` returns at exactly the moment the review
  has not run yet: an empty comment list read at that instant means "not
  reviewed yet", not "nothing to answer". Wait for **both** signals: every
  check must conclude, and the required current-head Codex cycle above must
  reach a terminal result. Green CI while that cycle is pending or incomplete
  is still non-terminal.
- **Stop at ready-for-review.** When the readiness gate below passes, promote
  the draft **exactly once** with `gh pr ready <n>`, confirm `isDraft == false`
  on the same head, report, and stop. Human approval is deliberately *not* a
  precondition: ready-for-review is the request for that review, not permission
  to merge. Merging is always a human decision.

### Readiness gate

The single definition of "the automated lifecycle is complete", used by
interactive shepherding and by Foreman alike. A draft may be marked ready for
review only when **all** of the following hold for its current `headRefOid`:

- Required CI checks have concluded successfully. An empty check list is
  *indeterminate*, not a pass — GitHub populates it asynchronously, so a read
  taken moments after the push reports nothing having run rather than nothing
  to run.
- The current-head Codex cycle above is terminal and clean (Codex review is
  enabled here; where it is off, this condition drops out).
- Every review finding is fixed, declined with evidence, or filed as follow-up
  work.
- Every inline review comment has its required per-thread reply.
- Every `## Deferred findings` entry in the PR body is ticked with its
  disposition.
- `reviewDecision` is not `CHANGES_REQUESTED`.
- `mergeStateStatus` is none of `DIRTY`, `BEHIND`, `UNKNOWN`.
- No newer push invalidated any result the gate relied on — re-read
  `headRefOid` immediately before promoting and compare.

A failed **or indeterminate** condition is not a pass: leave the PR draft, post
a blocker report naming what is unresolved, and stop. "The check never ran",
"the fetch errored", and "the reviewer never answered" are all indeterminate.
Promotion is the one-way door in this lifecycle — it notifies CODEOWNERS and
requested reviewers, and `gh pr ready --undo` cannot unsend that — so an
unproven condition means stay draft, not promote and watch.

## Critical Copier Gotchas

- **`--vcs-ref=HEAD` is load-bearing.** Without it, `copier copy` from a local path
  renders the **latest git tag**, silently ignoring all uncommitted AND committed-
  but-untagged work. With it, copier auto-includes dirty/untracked changes via a
  throwaway commit in a temp clone (`DirtyLocalWarning`) — your working tree is
  never touched. `scripts/test-template.sh` always passes it.
- Side-effectful copier answers (`bunch_add`, `github_remote_create`,
  `github_release_init`, `run_task_install`) must default to **no** so
  `copier copy --defaults` is CI-safe.
- **Optimize for regular rolling updates, not every historical migration path.**
  Repositories standardized by harmon-init are expected to stay near the current
  release. Give new answers sensible defaults and let the standardization PR apply
  repository-aware judgment. Do not add permanent migrations or version-pair
  fixtures for arbitrary old/new combinations; handle unusual version gaps and
  customizations in the downstream PR unless a demonstrated fleet-wide,
  deterministic transformation cannot be handled safely there.
- After changing `copier.yml` or anything in `template/`, `task test:template:all`
  must pass.

## Development Workflow

- No direct commits to main (enforced by lefthook `guard:no-commit-to-main` and the
  branch ruleset). Work on feature branches; PRs require code-owner review and the
  `verify` + `security` status checks.
- **Agents never merge to main** — no `gh pr merge`, `git merge`, or push to
  `main` without Evan's explicit, per-merge approval, even when CI is green and
  the ruleset would allow it. Open the draft PR and shepherd it — checks green
  with reviews unpolled is not the stopping point — then promote it through the
  readiness gate, report, and stop; merging is always a human decision.
  (`.claude/settings.json` backstops this with `permissions.ask` rules on merge
  commands.) `gh pr ready` is *not* a merge and agents may run it — but only
  out of a passing readiness gate, never to signal "I think this looks done".
- **Reply to every inline PR review comment in its own thread** — bot
  reviewers and humans alike. Treat findings as
  hypotheses: verify each against the code, fix what's confirmed, and post the
  rejection reasoning with evidence otherwise. Post replies with
  `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/comments/<comment-id>/replies -f body=…`
  (comment IDs from `gh api …/pulls/<n>/comments`). A rollup summary comment
  on the PR is optional in addition, never a substitute for per-thread
  replies.
- Git hooks are managed by **lefthook** (`task install:hooks`); every hook delegates
  to a Taskfile target so local hooks, CI, and manual runs execute identical
  commands. Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.
- Commit messages follow **Conventional Commits** (enforced by commitlint):
  types `build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style,
  test`.
- **A PR that changes `template/` must use a `fix:`/`feat:` (or breaking) PR
  title.** Consumers receive harmon-init only via `copier update` to a released
  tag, and squash-merge feeds the PR title to release-please, which tags only
  feat/fix/breaking — so a `chore:`/`docs:` title over `template/` would merge
  without cutting a release and downstream repos would never pick the change up.
  The `release-content-guard.yml` check enforces this; **retitle rather than
  bypass** (e.g. `fix: update to harmon-init …`, not `chore:`). Non-`template/`
  changes (docs, this repo's own tooling) keep their normal type. Pre-flight it
  locally before opening the PR with your intended title:
  `PR_TITLE="<title>" BASE_SHA=main task guard:release-title`.

## Second-Model Review (Codex)

A second AI model (the OpenAI Codex CLI) reviews changes on demand — opt-in
for generated repos via the `use_codex_review` answer; this repo dogfoods it.
Local and advisory only: nothing runs in CI, and no `verify`/`ci` step depends
on Codex. Setup and mechanics: `docs/guides/codex-review.md`.

- `task challenge` (→ `challenge:codex`) — adversarial review: challenges the
  architecture and approach; hunts authorization bypasses, data-loss paths,
  unsafe rollback, races, hidden coupling, operational failure modes, and
  needless complexity. Steer it with e.g.
  `task challenge -- --base main focus on the update/migration path`.
- `task review` (→ `review:codex`) — verification checkpoint: double-checks
  the implementation, consistency, and test coverage before `task ci`.
- `task codex:gate:enable` / `:disable` / `:status` — the automatic
  Claude Code → Codex stop-gate (the codex plugin's Stop hook reviews each
  editing turn and blocks completion on material findings). Per-repo,
  per-machine state; defaults off. Inside Claude Code the equivalents are
  `/codex:review`, `/codex:adversarial-review`, and `/codex:setup`. The
  toggles are approval-gated (`permissions.ask`), `disable` refuses
  non-interactive shells, and agents must **never disable the gate to get
  past a BLOCK** — adjudicate the finding or escalate to Evan instead.

These tasks slot into the **Dev Loop** above: after `task verify` goes green,
before `task ci`. Codex cloud review is also connected to this repo's PRs —
it posts inline comments only for high-priority findings. During shepherding,
accept its clean comments, reviews, or reactions only under the current-head
cycle above: stale activity is not evidence for the current commit, and a lone
👀 that disappears or never resolves is an incomplete attempt.

**Codex Automatic reviews must stay disabled.** Codex triggers a cloud review
on three events: opening a PR for review, marking a draft ready, and an
explicit `@codex review`. The first two fire too late to inform a draft
workbench, and the second is actively harmful here — `gh pr ready` would kick
off a fresh asynchronous review *after* the gate that was supposed to complete
the automated work, so non-draft would stop meaning "ready for a human". The
lifecycle therefore uses explicit `@codex review` requests while the PR is
draft, per the current-head cycle above. Evan has set personal Auto review off
and the repository preference to **Follow personal**; that state is a
**human-configured prerequisite**, not something any API confirms, so never
report it as mechanically verified. If it changes, the readiness gate stops
being valid until it is restored. Mechanical enforcement is tracked separately
in [#486](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init/issues/486).

**Treat Codex findings as hypotheses, not authority.** For every finding:

1. Verify it against the actual implementation, surrounding code,
   requirements, and tests.
2. Classify it: confirmed, plausible but unproven, or false positive.
3. Fix only confirmed findings; add or improve regression tests where
   appropriate.
4. Explain why any rejected finding is incorrect or irrelevant.
5. Re-run `task verify` (and the other relevant gates) after fixes.
6. Finish with a concise adjudication table: finding → priority →
   classification → evidence → action taken.

**Between rounds, check what the findings are about.** Those six steps are all
*per-finding*, so a reviewer can be right every round while the loop as a whole
diverges: each fix adds surface, the next round attacks that surface, and the
findings stay individually defensible right up to the cap. Before starting a
round's fixes, ask where they *live* — in the change you set out to make, or in
code that exists only because an earlier round asked for it. **A round whose
findings are all about the previous round's fix is the tell**, and it is
visible in round 2 — the first round that can show it. Do not wait for the
pattern to be unmistakable in round 3, by which point only one round is left.

**Deleting the added code is a legitimate way to reach a clean pass.** When a
round's findings are about scaffolding rather than the change, weigh removing
that scaffolding against hardening it once more — a remediation can be correct
in the abstract and wrong for the artifact. A documentation guide that has
grown a hand-rolled process supervisor earns real, defensible P1s about per-run
state, process-group supervision, and PID reuse; every one of them becomes moot
when the recipe is deleted instead of hardened. That is not giving up on the
findings: the stage exits on a **clean re-run**, and a re-run does not care
whether a finding was answered or made inapplicable. Name the mooted findings
in the adjudication table *and* in the message of the commit that removes the
code — the table is scrollback, but the commit is why the code is gone, and it
is the record a later round or a different session can still find.

One endpoint is worth knowing: if the deletion empties the change *entirely*,
there is no clean pass to reach — `codex-review.sh` refuses an empty scope
non-zero by design, so the stage cannot pass and re-running will not change
that. Treat it as the answer rather than a failure to work around: a change
that has become empty is abandoned, not reviewed clean.

**Severity gating.** Both tasks ask Codex to label every finding `P0`
(breaks correctness, security, or data integrity in ordinary use, or breaks
an existing contract), `P1` (a real defect or materially wrong design
decision with a plausible trigger), or `P2` (worth knowing, not
merge-blocking: hardening, unlikely edge cases, maintainability, non-critical
test gaps). The scale is defined in `scripts/codex-review.sh`, not inherited
from the Codex CLI's own labels, so the gate keeps its meaning if Codex
changes its output. **Only P0 and P1 gate the local loops.** Adjudicate P2s
too — never suppress or ignore one — but carry them to the PR-shepherd stage
rather than spending a local round on them. A P2 you judge worth fixing
immediately may of course be fixed in place; it just does not hold the stage
open.

**Deferring P2s.** The handoff is the **PR description**: list every deferred
P2 under a `## Deferred findings` heading as an unchecked task-list item —
`- [ ] <file:line> — <finding>` — with enough detail to adjudicate it later.
This is not bookkeeping: `task challenge` and `task review` run locally and
their output is ephemeral, and the cloud reviewer reposts only high-priority
findings, so a P2 that is not written into the PR body is simply lost.

Record each one **the moment you defer it**. Challenge and review both run
before `gh pr create`, so there is usually no PR body to write to yet: append
it to the file
`git rev-parse --git-path "deferred-findings/$(git branch --show-current)"`
names (`mkdir -p` its directory first) — but only if that finding is not
already listed. A stage exits on a *clean re-run*,
so an unchanged P2 is reported again by design, in every remaining round and
again by the next stage; appending blindly would hand the shepherd four copies
of one finding to settle. Match on location plus substance, not exact
wording — the same finding rarely comes back phrased identically. Then
move the list into the description when you open the PR (then delete the
file). Terminal scrollback is not a record — a context reset between
`task challenge` and `gh pr create` would take the findings with it.

**Sweep for orphans when you open the PR.** List the whole tree —
`ls -R "$(git rev-parse --git-path deferred-findings)"` — and account for
every file it holds, not just your branch's. Renaming a branch (`git branch
-m`) or deleting one strands its notes under the old name, where nothing will
ever look for them again; a rename mid-change is exactly when that happens.
Adopt an orphan into this PR if it belongs to this work, otherwise leave it
and say it is there. Listing costs one command; migration logic would cost a
mechanism that then needs its own correctness argument.

That path is not arbitrary. It sits in the **git directory**, so it is
deterministic (any later session in this checkout finds it the same way, and
`git rev-parse` resolves it correctly inside a linked worktree) and invisible
to `git status`. It is keyed by **branch** because an ordinary clone switches
branches in place: with one shared file, opening branch B's PR would sweep up
branch A's findings and then delete A's only copy of them. The branch name
becomes a *path*, verbatim and without a suffix — folding `/` to `-` would
collide `feat/x` with `feat-x` and reintroduce exactly that loss, and adding
an extension would make `foo` (a file) block `foo.md/bar` (needing a
directory). Used as-is, the mapping is git's own ref namespace, and git
already forbids one live branch from being a path prefix of another. A note in the *worktree* would be worse than none:
`codex-review.sh` puts uncommitted files in scope whenever the tree is dirty,
so the note would be handed to the next bare `task challenge` as part of the
change under review — a file of open findings, presented to the reviewer as
work to adjudicate.

The shepherd stage settles every entry and **edits the PR body to tick it**
(`- [x] … — fixed in <sha>` / `declined: <reason>` / `filed as #<n>`) in the
same round. The checkbox is the resolution state: an entry left unchecked is
open work, so a later round — or a different session — can tell at a glance
what it still owes without re-adjudicating what is done. That obligation is
stated here and in the Dev Loop above, and holds whether or not the optional
`/shepherd` skill is installed to automate it.

**Loop cap and exit:** a stage exits only on a **clean re-run** — no
confirmed P0 or P1 findings — never on "findings fixed" alone, with at most
**4** challenge iterations and **4** review iterations (challenge → fix →
re-challenge, and likewise for review). If P0/P1 disagreement persists at the
cap, stop and surface it to Evan instead of iterating further.

One caveat on the automatic stop-gate: the codex plugin's Stop hook applies
its **own** notion of a material finding and may BLOCK on something you have
classified P2. Adjudicate it (fix it, or state the reasoning) — **never**
disable the gate to get past a BLOCK.

## Conventions

Full reference: [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md). Highlights beyond
the workflow rules above:

- `group:action` Taskfile naming (e.g. `lint:shell`, not `shell:lint`); pin
  actions by SHA + `# vX.Y.Z`.
- Git hooks are managed by lefthook (`lefthook.yml`) and delegate to Taskfile
  targets — don't duplicate logic in hooks or workflows.
- Secrets never go in git; local env via 1Password (`op run` / `op inject`).
- When generating or rotating secrets, keep secret values on stdin and use the
  destination-only helpers:
  `task secret:set:1p VAULT=... ITEM=... FIELD=... [SECTION=...]` for existing
  1Password fields and `task secret:set:gh NAME=... REPO=owner/repo` for GitHub
  repo secrets. Never pass secret values as command arguments, `--body` values,
  exported env vars, or Taskfile vars. The hard rule above still applies:
  agents must not run `secret:set:1p` or otherwise write to a password manager
  without explicit user confirmation for that exact write.
- The skills sync manages ONLY the directories listed on the `# managed:` line
  of `.claude/skills/.SKILLS_PROVENANCE`. Anything else under `.claude/skills/`
  is a local skill this repo owns; never hand-edit a vendored one — change it in
  harmon-devkit and bump the pin.

## Code Style

- Indentation: 2 spaces default; 4 spaces for Python/Terraform/Shell
  (see `.editorconfig`).
- Shell scripts must pass `shellcheck --severity=error` and `shfmt -d`, and stay
  portable across macOS bash 3.2 (no `mapfile`, no `grep -P`) and Linux.
- Keep Taskfile `cmds:` trivial. Inline command strings are **not** seen by
  `shellcheck`/`shfmt` (`lint:shell` only covers `scripts/*.sh`), so non-trivial
  logic — pipelines, conditionals, loops, `curl | bash`, anything with `&&`/`||`
  — belongs in a `scripts/*.sh` file that the task calls. `task test:tasks` guards
  the floor (the Taskfile compiles; setup tasks are safe no-ops), but extracting
  the shell is what actually gets it linted.
- YAML linted with yamllint; workflows with actionlint; markdown with
  markdownlint-cli2.
- Pin third-party GitHub Actions by commit SHA with a trailing version comment and
  manage tool versions with `# renovate:` datasource annotations.

## CI/CD

- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — jobs `lint`, `security`, `template-test` (matrix
  of copier answer profiles), and the aggregate `verify` gate. All jobs delegate to
  `task` targets.
- `.github/workflows/devcontainer-build.yml` — builds the dual-profile
  devcontainer images (bot + dev) and pushes them to GHCR as build caches. The
  root repo dogfoods the same `.devcontainer/` the template generates
  (`task test:devcontainer:root` / `test:devcontainer:dev` smoke-test them).
  Rendered template devcontainers are config-validated (`read-configuration` in
  `template-test`), **not** built per profile — the dogfood build covers every
  profile only because the template `Dockerfile` is kept free of copier
  conditionals (profile-invariant). See `docs/architecture/ci-cd.md`.
- `.github/workflows/publish-harmon-devcontainer.yml` — root-only producer for
  the public shared amd64/arm64 toolchain image. Candidate PRs build without
  registry credentials; trusted `main` publishes immutable source tags and the
  tested helper maintains one reviewed consumer-pin PR. See
  `docs/architecture/devcontainer-image.md`.
- `.github/workflows/claude-{plan,implement,review}.yml` — Claude Code GitHub
  Actions. They (and `release.yml`) authenticate as the CI **GitHub App**
  (`CI_APP_CLIENT_ID` variable + `CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secret) and need the
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret. See `docs/architecture/security.md`.
- Dependency updates via Renovate (`renovate.json`); second-model reviews use
  Codex.
- `release.yml` runs release-please: releases stay intentional (merge the rolling
  release PR to cut a tag); `task release:*` remains a manual override.
- `release-content-guard.yml` fails a PR that changes `template/` under a
  non-releasing title (see Development Workflow) — the guard logic is
  `scripts/require-release-title.sh` (unit-tested by `task test:release-title`),
  driven by the `RELEASE_CONTENT_PATHS` var on the `guard:release-title` task.
  Generated repos render the same guard from the `release_content_paths` copier
  answer (empty = no guard).
