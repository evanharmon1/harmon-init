# Project Management

How work is tracked for Harmon Init in **GitHub Projects**.

## One default project per owner

The standard strategy is a single default GitHub **Project (V2)** per owner — one
board for the organization, or (for personal-account repos) one for the user
account — titled after the owner's GitHub login: `<owner> Project` (here:
**evanharmon1 Project**; e.g. `harmonops Project`, `evanharmon1 Project`).
Every repo the owner controls feeds that one board; an issue can belong to
multiple projects, but this default board is its home. Reach for a second,
focused project only when a body of work needs its own.

## Status pipeline

`Status` is a single-select field with exactly one meaning: **where in the flow
toward delivery is this.** The columns, grouped:

**Backlog** — triage; not yet committed

- Inbox — newly landed, unsorted
- Icebox — real, but not now
- Next — will pull in soon

**Unstarted** — committed to a cycle, not yet in motion

- Todo
- Shaping — problem/approach still being defined
- Ready — shaped, ready to pick up
- Agent Queue — queued for an AI agent to implement

**Started** — in motion, partial progress

- In Progress
- Verifying — CI/checks running
- In Review — under human review
- Ready to Merge — approved, awaiting merge

**Completed**

- Done — merged/shipped; the single terminal status
- Deployed
- Accepted — smoke/QA/manual check passed, communicated, released

Archiving isn't a status — it's a separate native axis. GitHub's built-in
**auto-archive** removes finished items from the board (into the retrievable
Archived-items view), so aged `Done` items leave the board automatically instead
of sitting in an "Archived" column.

## Status is not issue state

GitHub has **two independent state machines**, and conflating them is the most
common way to make a board lie:

- **Issue state** — `open` / `closed`, native to the issue.
- **Status** — the custom pipeline field above, layered on top.

`Status` answers *"where in the delivery flow is this."* It is **not** where you
record *why something left the flow without shipping* — GitHub has a dedicated
axis for that, the **close reason**.

### Canceled and Duplicate are close reasons, not statuses

They aren't pipeline positions; they're terminal closure reasons, and GitHub
already has an axis for those that's separate from `Status` by design. When you
close an issue you pick **Completed**, **Not planned**, or **Duplicate**:

- **Cancel / won't-fix / stale** → close as **Not planned** — explicitly the
  bucket for exactly this.
- **Duplicate** → close as **Duplicate** (shipped December 2024). You select the
  duplicated issue, which produces a timeline event and a note at the top making
  the closure reason clear.

Neither needs a `Status` value, and **Done** stays the single terminal status
meaning "shipped." Why not add `Canceled`/`Duplicate` columns anyway, given
Linear has a Canceled group? Because in Linear the status *is* the state, so
"Canceled" closes the work atomically with that meaning. GitHub split them:
`Status` is a custom field layered on an issue that keeps its own independent
open/closed state.

### Automation gotcha

The built-in **"issue closed → Done"** rule doesn't look at *why* the issue
closed, so closing something as Not planned or Duplicate would paint it **Done**
on the board — wrong. Gate it:

- Drive Done off **"PR merged → Done"** for the success path.
- On a raw close event, check `state_reason == completed` before setting Done.

Items closed as not-planned/duplicate just stay closed and fall off the board;
their `Status` value goes vestigial, which is fine — nothing open-filtered shows
them.

## Blocked is not a status

A `Blocked` column buys you visibility you already get for free, and it fights
automation: statuses are artifact-driven (PR opened → Verifying) while "blocked"
is a manual human overlay — an item that's "Blocked" but has an open PR is a
contradiction the automation can't resolve. Blocked is **orthogonal** to pipeline
position; keep it off that axis. There are two kinds, and they want different
tools:

- **Blocked by another issue** (the common case) — use the native **"Mark as
  blocked by"** relationship (issue dependencies, GA 2025-08-21). It records
  *what's* blocking (the actual issue, not a bare flag), shows the **Blocked**
  icon on the board and Issues page automatically, is queryable with
  `is:blocked`, and is fully programmatic (`gh issue view` shows Blocked by /
  Blocking; `--json blockedBy,blocking`; REST endpoints add/list/remove).
  When the blocker closes, the relationship reflects it. Up to 50 issues per
  relationship type.
- **Blocked by a non-issue** — waiting on a Twilio 10DLC approval, an upstream
  library fix, a pricing decision, info from a customer. The native feature can't
  express this (an issue only becomes "blocked" by depending on another issue),
  so this is the **`blocked` label's** job: it means "stuck on a non-issue
  thing," with the actual reason in a comment.

One upgrade for that second case: model a *significant or shared* external
blocker as its own **tracking issue** ("Twilio 10DLC brand approval") and mark
the real work blocked-by it — that pulls the external dependency into the native
mechanism (board icon, `is:blocked`, auto-resolve). Worth it when several items
wait on the same thing; reserve the bare label for one-off, transient blockers.

## Automations

Projects are **org-level** objects, but automations trigger from **events**, and
issue/PR events are repo-local. That splits automation three ways:

1. **Triggered by repo activity (issue/PR events)** — the workflow *must* live in
   the repo where the activity happens; a workflow in one repo never sees
   another's PR events. In a polyrepo org the same automation runs in every repo
   whose issues/PRs feed the project.
2. **Triggered by a schedule or `workflow_dispatch`** — no per-repo trigger to
   distribute, so pick one hub/ops repo and run it there.
3. **Not an Action at all** — the project's **built-in workflows**.

Start with #3: **push everything you can onto the built-in workflows.** They're
configured on the project itself, fire on project-item events, and work
org-project-wide across every repo with zero Actions and zero per-repo setup —
Backlog on add, In Review on review-requested, Done on merge, Done on close,
auto-close, auto-archive. Drop to Actions only for the gaps built-ins don't
cover.

TODO: finalize exactly what to automate. The intended event → status shape:

- New issue → **Inbox**
- Branch/PR started → **In Progress**
- PR opened → **In Review**
- Deployment complete → verification (if applicable)
- Issue closed (`state_reason == completed`) → **Done**
- 90 days in Done → **auto-archived** off the board (native built-in, not a Status)

## Custom fields

Beyond `Status`, the project carries:

- **Priority**
- **Estimate** — size/effort
- **Product** — which product/area it belongs to
- **Agent** — which agent should implement it (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI,
  Qwen Code, DeepSeek, Kimi K2, GLM, GitHub Copilot) and how (effort level, model)

TODO: finalize each field's options/values.

## Notes

- **Labels vs Type** — `Type` is a first-class, org-level issue field
  (Bug / Feature / Task / Research), separate from labels; don't reproduce it as
  a label.
- **Views** — save per-slice views off the one board (by iteration, product, or
  agent) rather than spinning up more projects.
- **Owner**, **Iteration/cycle**, **Milestone** — additional fields/axes as the
  work needs them.
- **Sub-issues** — break a large issue down natively instead of with a checklist.
- An issue can belong to **multiple projects** — the org project plus a focused
  one is fine.
