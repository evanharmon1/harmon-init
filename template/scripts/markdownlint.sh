# Prefer the repo-pinned binary (node_modules/.bin) so hooks/CI match the
# lockfile; then a PATH-installed binary already AT the pin, which is what a
# provisioned machine (the devcontainer image, a remote VM the bootstrap set up)
# has; fall back to npx for non-node repos and fresh scaffolds. Invoking
# the .bin shim directly is package-manager-agnostic (works under npm too,
# where `pnpm exec` would break). Keeps this dispatch out of the
# Taskfile per the "keep cmds trivial; non-trivial shell lives in scripts/*.sh"
# rule.
#
# Usage:
#   markdownlint.sh check [glob-or-file ...]   # read-only gate
#   markdownlint.sh fix   [glob-or-file ...]   # best-effort auto-fix
# With no glob/file args, a canonical repo-wide default set is used.

# Prefer a repo-local install; then a PATH binary at the pin; otherwise fetch a
# PINNED version. Resolving `latest` here meant a new upstream rule could turn
# every repo red with no commit — the opposite of what a lint gate is for.
#
# The PATH step is there because `npx` never looks at PATH: it resolves a local
# or remote npm package. A machine the devcontainer image or the remote
# bootstrap provisioned already carries markdownlint-cli2 at this pin, and
# without this step `task check` re-downloaded it — so a job claiming to run
# with only what its setup installed did not, and an environment whose egress
# closes after setup could not run the gate at all.
#
# The version must MATCH the pin, and that is a safety condition rather than a
# nicety: preferring any PATH binary would silently downgrade every machine
# carrying an older global copy, which is the `latest` problem above in reverse.
# A failed probe, a mismatch, an unreadable banner, or a banner in an
# unrecognised shape all fall through to npx, so the pin decides what runs in
# every case.
#
# THE RULE: a read that can fail is not an answer. The probe's exit STATUS is
# taken first, and separately from parsing what it printed, because "it could
# not say" and "it said the wrong version" are different facts and only the
# second is about the pin. Discarding the status with `|| true` accepted a binary
# that printed the pinned banner and exited nonzero — a damaged global install, a
# broken wrapper, a Node runtime that has moved out from under it — as the pinned
# linter, and `task check` then ran that broken executable in place of the npx
# package that works.
#
# images/devcontainer/install/lib.sh states the same rule for the image's own
# version probes (harmon_installed_version), and the duplication is DELIBERATE
# rather than an oversight: this dispatcher cannot source that helper. It is
# root-only — part of harmon-init's image build, with no template twin — so it
# does not exist in a generated repository at all, and where it does exist it is
# a file the image or the remote bootstrap installed, so sourcing it would make
# resolving the linter depend on a provisioned machine. That is the one thing
# this script must not assume: it also runs on fresh scaffolds and unprovisioned
# CI. A change to the rule belongs in both places.
