# lint-shell-robustness.sh — guard the two shell idioms whose EXIT STATUS LIES.
#
# 1. `PRODUCER | grep -q PATTERN` under `set -o pipefail` (#689). # shell-robustness: ok — this line names the shape the guard forbids
#    `grep -q` exits the moment it matches. The producer is usually still
#    writing, so it takes SIGPIPE and dies 141; `pipefail` then reports the
#    whole pipeline as FAILED even though grep MATCHED. Measured here: 0/100
#    false failures at 150 B, 1/100 at 1.5 kB, 94/100 at 84 kB, 200/200 at
#    349 kB. Seen in production, not just tests — the triage skill's
#    `axes_active()` silently dropped a classification axis this way.
#
#      grep -qF "$needle" <<<"$haystack"          # a string
#      grep -q PATTERN < <(some-command --args)   # a command
#      out="$(cmd)" && grep -q PATTERN <<<"$out"  # when cmd's success is
#                                                 # itself part of the check
#
# 2. A test reporter (`ok`, `bad`, `pass`, …) that does not end in `return 0`.
#    Assertions are written `check && ok "…" || bad "…"`, so the reporter's own
#    status sits inside the branch: if its `echo` fails on the grouped-output
#    pipe `task` runs suites under, a PASSING assertion reports as a failure.
#
#      ok() {
#          pass=$((pass + 1))
#          echo "  ✓ $*" || true
#          return 0
#      }
#
# WHY THIS IS DELIBERATELY OVER-EAGER, AND HAS NO PARSER
#
# The first version of this guard parsed shell: it tracked quote, here-doc and
# command-substitution state so it could tell code from text. Four adversarial
# review rounds found ELEVEN ways to make that lexer report a file clean while
# the forbidden construct was plainly present — a herestring read as a here-doc
# opener, an apostrophe in a comment, a multi-line command substitution, a
# quote closing mid-line, several here-docs on one line, `<<EOF-X`, backticks,
# continued option lines, a brace on its own line, and more. Shell grammar is
# much larger than any subset a guard can afford to model, so that list was
# never going to close.
#
# A guard that reports a dirty tree CLEAN is worse than no guard, because
# people trust it. So this version does not try to be clever: it matches TEXT,
# flags everything that looks like the forbidden shape — inside comments, inside
# here-doc bodies, inside quoted strings, everywhere — and makes each genuine
# exception state itself out loud:
#
#   … code …                # shell-robustness: ok — why this one is fine
#
#   # shell-robustness: begin-exempt — why this whole region is fine
#   … lines, e.g. a here-doc whose body must stay byte-exact …
#   # shell-robustness: end-exempt
#
#   # shell-robustness: exempt-file — why every match in this file is deliberate
#
# Every form REQUIRES a reason after the em dash (or `--`); a marker without one
# is itself an error, so the escape hatch cannot be used silently. False
# positives are loud and cost a reviewer one annotation. False negatives were
# invisible and cost four review rounds.
#
# TWO KNOWN LIMITATIONS, both accepted deliberately. Closing either needs the
# parsing this guard exists to avoid, and each fails in a bounded way:
#
#   * A here-doc fixture containing a well-formed `begin-exempt` … `end-exempt`
#     pair exempts the real code between those fixtures. Telling a marker in
#     fixture text from a marker in code needs here-doc tracking — the lexer
#     that produced a bypass in every review round. Mitigations: `exempt-file`,
#     which disables a WHOLE file, is restricted to the file header where
#     fixture text cannot reach; both markers must carry a reason; and an
#     unclosed block is itself reported.
#
# Known coverage gap in the pipeline half: the `grep` token itself is matched
# literally, so a path-qualified (`/usr/bin/grep`), escaped (`\grep`) or quoted
# spelling is not seen. No such spelling exists in this tree today; the
# remaining forms are enumerated in #848 to be closed in one change rather than
# one review round at a time.
#
# The two halves are not equally strong, and the header says so rather than
# leaving a reader to assume otherwise. The PIPELINE check above is a stateless
# text match and is the deliverable of #689. The REPORTER check below is
# structural — it finds a definition and scans its block — and is therefore
# BEST-EFFORT: its remaining corners (the `function NAME {` stop-condition
# spelling, and its siblings) are enumerated and tracked in #838 rather than
# closed one per review round. It exists to stop the reporter defect returning
# in the obvious form, not to prove path-completeness.
#
#   * The reporter check asks whether an executable `return 0` is PRESENT in
#     the block, so one inside an `if` satisfies it even though the ordinary
#     path may still end on a failing `echo`. Answering "does every path end
#     safely" is body and path analysis, which was deleted from this guard
#     after producing a finding in every round. The `return 0` sweep in the
#     change that introduced this guard already removed the defect tree-wide;
#     this check exists to stop it returning in the obvious form.
#
# Scope: every tracked shell script under scripts/ and template/scripts/. The
# reporter check additionally applies only to test-*.sh suites.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/lint-shell-robustness.sh [file ...]
#   With no arguments, checks every tracked file in scope.
