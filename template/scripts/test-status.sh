# test-status.sh — unit-test the two things status.sh reports about credentials:
#
#   * "Project board writes" (`task status:gh`) — the token scope the claim
#     lifecycle needs, reported from the section session-start orientation
#     actually runs, in every scope state.
#   * "Local credentials" (`task status:creds` and `task status:setup`) — the gh
#     and Codex logins the Dev Loop gates on, in every state including
#     not-installed, rendered as its own section for the session-start hook AND
#     inside the setup audit BEFORE the gate that skips the rest of it, counted
#     by the summary at the end of that audit, and — standalone — spending
#     exactly one bounded network call, for the token scopes alone (#827).
#
# Run via `task test:status`.
#
# Hermetic in two directions:
#
#   * every `gh` call is answered by a stub on PATH, so this makes no network
#     requests and cannot depend on the scopes of the developer's own token —
#     which is the whole point. The bug it guards (a claim that silently no-ops
#     on a token without the scope) is INVISIBLE when tested with a token that
#     has it.
#   * the checks run against fixture roots this script builds, never against the
#     repo it lives in. status.sh resolves its own root from BASH_SOURCE and
#     feature-detects the board tooling from it, so a test that used the host
#     repo would assert one profile's layout and fail in every other — a repo
#     generated with `project_management: none` correctly omits the check.

#   skills-only — the DEFAULT generated profile: `project_management: none` with
#                 `use_skills_sync: true`, so the vendored universal skill set
#                 (track-work included) is present but there is no board
#   with-codex  — opted into second-model review, so the Codex login is a gate.
#                 The other three have no codex-review.sh, which is what makes
#                 them the not-opted-in case for that check.
#   creds-board — codex opted in AND board tooling present, so the session-start
#                 scope check demands the Projects scopes. Its twin below
#                 (with-codex, no board) is what proves that demand is gated.

# copy is how one call site silently drifts back to advice that cannot work,
# and the setup section (which needs live GitHub data to render) cannot be
# driven by the stub above. So assert it statically.
#
# The class is wider than refresh, and the bot profile is why
# (harmon-init#1236). There, EVERY remedy that acts on the current gh login is
# wrong, not just the one that cannot work: the gh-identity tripwire may be
# about to report that login as a personal credential which must be removed,
# and advice to use it (`gh auth login`) or widen it (`gh auth refresh -s`,
# `task setup:gh-scopes`) on the same screen re-creates the exact escalation
# the tripwire exists to stop. Challenge found two such sites in two
# consecutive rounds — the setup audit's login line, then the scope remedy —
# so the guard is written against the class.
#
# The literal may appear only in a comment or inside one of the profile-aware
# derivation helpers, which ARE the rule.

# then the assignment WAS the derivation. It no longer is, and that exemption
# had become a hole wide enough to drive the finding through: `GH_REMEDY_DEFAULT
# ="see: task setup:gh-scopes"` matched it and sailed past. Mutation-verified
# after removal. The patterns below are deliberately the RUNNABLE recommendation
# forms — `gh auth refresh -s` rather than bare `gh auth refresh` — so
# derive_gh_scope_state is exempt on the same grounds as the other two: it IS
# the derivation, and its "an env token overrides gh auth refresh" branches
# explain why that command will not work rather than recommending it. The

# ── run_timeout actually bounds a probe (harmon-init#865) ───────────────────

# A deadline is NOT a bound here. status.sh reads every probe through `$(...)`,
# and a command substitution returns when the write end of its pipe closes, not
# when `timeout` exits — so a probe that blocks on stdin, or that survives the
# SIGTERM the deadline sends, hangs the board FOREVER while `timeout` has long
# since reported 124. That is what `task status` did in a devcontainer terminal:
# `claude auth status --json` waits on a terminal stdin, and nothing downstream
# was left to fire.
#
# Both cases are driven from a stdin that is open and silent, the way a terminal
# with nobody typing at it is. The outer deadline is the test's own safety net:
# a regression must FAIL here, not wedge CI.
