# Shared, read-only GitHub REST helpers for session scripts.
#
# These helpers deliberately avoid gh subcommands backed by GraphQL and gh
# api --paginate. Claude Code's repository proxy permits repos/{owner}/{repo}
# REST reads, but rejects GraphQL, search, and the numeric repository links gh
# follows after the first --paginate page.
#
# Every walk is bounded twice: by the caller's MAX_ITEMS, and by
# GH_REST_MAX_PAGES (default 10), a whole-operation page ceiling that stops the
# loop and returns 4 once exceeded — so no caller can reintroduce an unbounded
# whole-repository walk by passing MAX_ITEMS=0. Raise it deliberately, per
# call, when an operation genuinely needs more than 1000 items.
#
# Host handling: gh_rest_api derives the GitHub host once per call
# (gh_rest_host) and passes --hostname to gh for any host other than
# github.com, so an Enterprise remote or a host-qualified GH_REPO is read from
# the host it names. Export GH_REST_HOST to short-circuit the derivation (an
# empty value means "no --hostname").

# gh_rest_repo [REMOTE] — print OWNER/REPO from GH_REPO or a git remote.
# GH_REPO may carry gh's documented [HOST/]OWNER/REPO form; the host segment is
# dropped here (gh_rest_host recovers it) so endpoints stay repos/OWNER/REPO.
#
# An explicitly passed REMOTE outranks GH_REPO. An argument is the caller's
# deliberate statement about which remote to resolve; GH_REPO is ambient
# configuration that may name an unrelated repository. A caller that iterates
# remotes — audit-session-artifacts.sh does — would otherwise read its
# pull-request evidence from GH_REPO's repository while every other section of
# the same audit stayed on the remote it had selected (integration r2). With no
# argument GH_REPO keeps its precedence: every other caller relies on that, and
# this repository's workflows export it deliberately.

# gh_rest_host [REMOTE] — print the GitHub host the repository lives on: the
# HOST/ prefix of GH_REPO when present, else GH_HOST (gh's own override, which
# gh_target_host in gh-scopes.sh honours the same way), else the host of the
# remote URL (https://HOST[:PORT]/..., ssh://git@HOST[:PORT]/...,
# [user@]HOST:...),
# else nothing. Always exits 0: an empty result means "let gh pick", never an
# error.
#
# An explicitly passed REMOTE outranks both GH_REPO and GH_HOST, for the reason
# gh_rest_repo does and on the same argument: the two functions answer about the
# same remote, so a caller passing one must not get the argument's repository
# paired with ambient configuration's host. With no argument both keep their
# precedence, unchanged.
#
# A colon means a different thing in each form, so the port is read per form
# rather than stripped from all three (challenge r4):
#   https://HOST:PORT/...   the port is part of the API AUTHORITY — an
#                           Enterprise instance published on 8443 answers
#                           nowhere else, so it is KEPT and travels on into
#                           --hostname.
#   ssh://git@HOST:PORT/... an SSH TRANSPORT port (2222 through a bastion, say)
#                           says nothing about where the API listens: DROPPED.
#   [user@]HOST:OWNER/REPO  scp-like, so the colon introduces the PATH and there
#                           is no port to keep. The userinfo is OPTIONAL: git
#                           reads `ghe.example.com:acme/repo` as ssh too, and an
#                           arm that required `@` dropped that host silently
#                           while gh_rest_repo still resolved acme/repo — an
#                           Enterprise read sent to the default host (review r1).
