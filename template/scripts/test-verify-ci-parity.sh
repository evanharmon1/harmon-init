# `verify` and the required Build workflow run their `test:*` targets through
# ONE aggregate Taskfile task (test:suite), so the two lists cannot drift
# (harmon-init#962, #1461). This is the whole guard: it fails when the Build
# workflow's lint job stops calling that task, when `verify` stops calling it,
# or when `verify` gains a `test:*` entry of its own that the workflow would
# never run. Plain text only — a block is the lines from its key to the next
# key at the same two-space indent; no YAML or shell is parsed, and `task`
# itself is not needed.
