#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-label-registry.sh — the OFFLINE gate that binds label provisioning, the
# docs taxonomy and rubric tables, and the status inventory to the machine-readable label
# registry (label-registry.json). Runs in `task verify` / `task ci`, next to
# test-registry-drift.sh (which owns the agent-registry bindings).
#
#   1. schema      — the manifest validates (validate-label-registry.mjs:
#                    structure, per-value overrides, arming confinement,
#                    GitHub's 50/100-char limits).
#   2. cross-file  — the rigor family's values match .devflow.toml's [rigor.*]
#                    levels, and the foreman protocol per-value colors
#                    reproduce the four upstream foreman label colors.
#   3. lockfile    — TEMPLATE repo only: the rendered provisioned set equals
#                    the reviewed expectation frozen below (the pre-manifest
#                    inline vocabulary plus the hand-seeded families) plus the
#                    live agent-registry render. A vocabulary change edits the
#                    manifest AND this lockfile in one PR — that is the point:
#                    the provisioned set changes deliberately or not at all.
#   4. provisioning— setup-github-labels.sh, run with `gh` stubbed, provisions
#                    exactly the renderer's set (no hand-list can fork).
#   5. status      — scripts/status.sh reads its expected-label inventory from
#                    the same renderer (no stale heredoc parse).
#   6. docs        — the taxonomy table between the label-taxonomy markers in
#                    docs/project-management.md is exactly `docs-table` output,
#                    and the classification-rubric block is `rubric-table` output,
#                    per layer (the manifests legitimately diverge, so each
#                    layer renders its own expectation).
#
# TEMPLATE repository (template/label-registry.json exists): both layers are
# checked. GENERATED repository: the local manifest, script, status, and — when
# the render profile ships it — the docs table are checked; profile-dependent
# files are skipped loudly, like test-registry-drift.sh does.
