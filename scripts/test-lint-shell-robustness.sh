# The guard is deliberately over-eager and has no shell parser, so this suite
# is organised around that contract rather than around a lexer's corner cases:
#
#   1. every forbidden shape is flagged, including in contexts a parser would
#      have excused — comments, here-doc bodies, quoted strings, subshells;
#   2. the ELEVEN inputs that made the previous, parsing version of this guard
#      report a file CLEAN are each flagged now (see "mooted bypasses" below);
#   3. the fixed shapes and ordinary non-pipeline greps are not flagged;
#   4. an exemption must state a reason, and a marker without one is itself a
#      finding — the escape hatch cannot be used silently.
#
# shell-robustness: exempt-file — every forbidden construct below is a
# deliberate fixture. This file IS the guard's corpus of things that must be
# flagged, so annotating each one individually would say nothing a reader
# cannot already see from the assertion names.
#
# Run via `task test:lint-shell-robustness`.
