# setup-remote.sh — prepare THIS checkout for the dev loop on a remote platform.

# A devcontainer does this in post-create/post-start; remote platforms (Claude
# Code on the web, Codex cloud, ...) run neither and no hook fires, so an agent
# runs `task setup:remote` once on a fresh checkout. Every step is idempotent and
# a safe no-op when already done:
#
#   1. lefthook install     so the pre-commit / commit-msg / pre-push gates run
#   2. frozen dependencies  pnpm-lock.yaml -> pnpm, uv.lock -> uv (only for a
#                           lockfile that exists; none is a no-op)
#   3. related repos        .devcontainer/related-repos.txt cloned beside this
#                           checkout (its PARENT directory), by the same script
#                           the devcontainer uses
#
# Never prompts (git: GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 and, unless GIT_SSH_COMMAND is already set,
# ssh BatchMode; pnpm: CI=true). A step whose tool is missing is reported as skipped; the exit
# status is non-zero only when a step that could run failed. A related repo that
# cannot be cloned is a warning from the bootstrap script, not a failure.
