# guard-closing-keywords.sh — assemble the commit range and PR metadata that
# check-closing-keywords.sh needs, then run it.
#
# Why a script and not inline Taskfile `cmds:`: inline command strings are not
# seen by shellcheck/shfmt (`lint:shell` only covers `scripts/*.sh`), so this
# logic — traps, temp files, `git log`, `gh api` — was unlinted and untestable
# where it used to live (harmon-init#1196). The Taskfile target is now a
# one-liner that calls this file.
#
# Where it runs:
#   - CI (`closing-keywords.yml`) supplies PR metadata from the event payload
#     and never invokes this script; it calls check-closing-keywords.sh with a
#     trusted default-branch copy of that program.
#   - Locally, as the pre-PR pre-flight documented in AGENTS.md beside
#     `guard:release-title`, and as the first step of `task ci`.
#
# Inputs (all optional; every one has a documented fallback):
#   BASE_SHA   base commit-ish for the range          (default: origin/main)
#   HEAD_SHA   head commit-ish for the range          (default: HEAD)
#   PR_TITLE   the PR title  — see "PR metadata" below
#   PR_BODY    the PR body   — see "PR metadata" below
#   GH_REPO    [HOST/]OWNER/REPO — gh's own documented form, and the only
#              input read here; it is resolved through gh_rest_repo, which
#              drops any HOST/ segment so endpoints stay repos/OWNER/REPO.
#              The host is not lost: it travels separately, as the
#              --hostname gh_rest_api derives from gh_rest_host.
#              (default: the current git remote)
#
# PR metadata: both PR_TITLE and PR_BODY are used verbatim when BOTH are set —
# which is how you pre-flight a title/body you have not published yet:
#
#   PR_TITLE="fix: …" PR_BODY="$(cat body.md)" task guard:closing-keywords
#
# If either is unset, the open PR for the current branch supplies both. That PR
# is found by selecting the bounded open-PR listing LOCALLY on
# .head.ref == the branch name and NOTHING else — the semantics of the
# `gh pr list --head "$branch"` this replaced. The filter runs here rather than
# server side because a `head=OWNER:branch` query built from the BASE
# repository's owner matches no PR opened from a fork, which silently demoted a
# real fork PR to the placeholder metadata below (challenge r3); a local match
# on the ref has never had that blind spot. The ref is the whole selector: the
# local head SHA used to narrow a ref several open PRs share, and that read the
# wrong PR's title and body whenever the branch's own PR had advanced remotely
# while an unrelated same-ref PR still carried this checkout's stale commit
# (challenge r5). Two forks can share a ref, and telling their PRs apart needs
# head-repository identity this checkout does not have — so several matches take
# the fail-closed path below. Refusing is the honest answer; guessing is not.
#
# Before a PR exists, a successful, COMPLETE and empty listing substitutes inert
# placeholder metadata so the commit messages are still scanned. Two things are
# indeterminate instead: a failed listing, and one that filled its bound without
# matching — a partial list cannot witness an absence, and grading it as "no PR"
# would quietly demote this guard to a commit-only scan (the invariant the
# status.sh inventories encode, challenge r2). Commit messages are read as data,
# never executed.
#
# Exit: 0 = ok, 1 = violation, 2 = indeterminate (refused to guess).
